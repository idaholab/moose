# MOOSE: Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment

### Advanced capability, delivered simply

The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) is a finite-element, multiphysics framework primarily developed by Idaho National Laboratory. It provides a high-level interface to some of the most sophisticated nonlinear solver technology on the planet. MOOSE presents a straightforward API that aligns well with the real-world problems scientists and engineers need to tackle. Every detail about how an engineer interacts with MOOSE has been thought through, from the installation process through running your simulation on state of the art supercomputers, the MOOSE system will accelerate your research.

### Some of the capability at your fingertips:

 * Fully-coupled, fully-implicit multiphysics solver
 * Dimension independent physics
 * Automatically parallel (largest runs >100,000 CPU cores!)
 * Modular development simplifies code reuse
 * Built-in mesh adaptivity
 * Continuous and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) (at the same time!)
 * Intuitive parallel multiscale solves (see videos below)
 * Dimension agnostic, parallel geometric search (for contact related applications)
 * Flexible, plugable graphical user interface
 * ~30 plugable interfaces allow specialization of every part of the solve
 * Physics modules providing general capability for solid mechanics, phase field modeling, Navier-Stokes, heat conduction and more

### Have a different relationship with your framework

MOOSE is different. MOOSE is a way of developing software just as much as it is a finite-element framework. When we change something in the framework we contribute patches to you that fix your application! As MOOSE is developed we test against your tests each step of the way to ensure that we're not creating problems. MOOSE is developed directly on GitHub providing a unique workflow that ensures smooth community involvement. Every step of the way we make decisions to keep scientists and engineers doing... SCIENCE and ENGINEERING!
Real results, really delivered

Don't simply talk about that simulation you would like to do... make it a reality!
