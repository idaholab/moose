# Linear forward model shared by the secant, Newton, and action drivers in this directory.
#
# Solves the scalar ODE:  du/dt = param_pp,  u(0) = 0
# param_pp is a Receiver set by the parent each fixed-point iteration.
# Accumulates: u(t_n) = u(t_{n-1}) + param_pp * dt, so the per-step map y(p) is linear in p.
