- Massively parallel computation - successfully run on >100,000 processor cores
- Multiphysics solve capability - fully coupled and implicit solver
- Multiscale solve capability - multiple application can perform computation for a problem simultaneously
- Provides high level interface to implement customized physics, geometries, boundary conditions, and material models
- Initially developed to support nuclear R&D but now widely used for non-nuclear R&D also
