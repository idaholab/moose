# Solves a 3rd-order ODE associated with Jeffery-Hamel flow.
# See, for example: F. White, "Viscous Fluid Flow", pp. 168--172 for a
# derivation of the ODE. The 3rd-order ODE is recast as three
# first-order ODEs posed on the domain eta=(0,1).  Two of the solution
# components have initial data, but the third condition applies only
# at eta=1, so one has to iteratively attempt different initial
# condition values until one is found that give the proper final
# condition.  A Newton process can be used to converge the starting
# guess more quickly.  The ODEs to solve are:
#
# y0' = y1
# y1' = y2
# y2' = -2 * Re * alpha * y0 * y1 - 4 * alpha**2 * y1
#
# for 0 < eta < 1,
#
# With ICs:
# y0(0) = 1 (centerline velocity)
# y1(0) = 0 (centerline symmetry)
# y2(0) = guess
#
# where guess must be chosen iteratively such that y0(1)=0.
#
# Various things to consider:
# .) The step size in eta, "deta", must be small enough to guarantee accurate solution to the ODEs.
# .) The residual for the Newton iteration is: R(guess) = y0(1;guess)
# .) The derivative of this residual can be estimated by finite-differencing wrt guess.
# .) The Reynolds number is defined as: Re = (u_max * r * alpha) / nu
