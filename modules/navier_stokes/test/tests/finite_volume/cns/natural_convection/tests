    requirement = 'The system shall be able to solve steady natural convection simulations using the finite volume method, a density-based compressible Navier-Stokes equation set, and central differencing of the advection terms for Rayleigh numbers of'

    # Central differencing is unstable and consequently will produce slightly
    # different results with different numbers of processors and on different
    # architectures. So instead of doing an exodiff we will just make sure it
    # runs. Additionally our best limiter, the min_mod limiter, produces slow
    # convergence for Steady calculations and also is seemingly too diffusive in
    # conjunction with Kurganov-Tadmor for these natural convection problems.
    # E.g. it takes an unreasonable amount of mesh refinement before the flow
    # detaches from the walls (e.g. before you see the boundary layers form
    # which are an essential feature of these natural convection benchmarks)
