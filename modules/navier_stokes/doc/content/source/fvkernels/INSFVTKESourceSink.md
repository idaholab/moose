# INSFVTKESourceSink

The object computes the turbulent source and sink term for the turbulent kinetic energy equation.

Two terms are computed `destruction` = $\epsilon$ and `production` = $G_k$ and the term $\epsilon - G_k$ is
passed to the residual.

A different treatment is used for the bulk and the near wall regions.
Also, a different formulation is used for the $k-\epsilon$ and $k-\omega$-SST model.
The kernel selects automatinally which formulation to use regarding wether $\epsilon$ or $\omega$ are provided to the kernel:

- When $\epsilon$ is provided to the [!param](/FVKernels/INSFVTKESourceSink/epsilon) parameter, the model uses the $k-\epsilon$ formulation
- When $\omega$ is provided to the [!param](/FVKernels/INSFVTKESourceSink/omega) parameter, the model uses the $k-\omega$-SST formulation

## k-$\epsilon$ formulation

### Bulk formulation:

The turbulent production $G_k$ is modeled as:

\begin{equation}
G_k = \mu_t S^2 \,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $\mu_t$ is the turbulent dynamic viscosity,
- $S$ is the shear strain tensor internal norm, defined as $S = \sqrt{2\mathbf{S}:\mathbf{S}}$ with the shear strain tensor defined as $\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{2} [\nabla \vec{u} + (\nabla \vec{u})^T]$.

The turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate $\epsilon$ is generally coming from a coupled
transport equation for $\epsilon$.
However, for canonical or measured cases, e.g., isotropic decaying turbulence,
the user can utilize predefined fields through functors in MOOSE.

To avoid the overproduction of turbulent kinetic energy in stagnation zones \cite{durbin1996k}, a production limiter is imposed in relation to the dissipation using the formulation in \cite{menter1994two}:

\begin{equation}
G_k = min \left( G_k , C_{PL} \rho \epsilon \right) \,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $C_{PL}$ it the limiter constant, and set by default to a recommended value of 10 \cite{durbin1996k}.

### Wall formulation:

All cells in contact with a boundary identified in the [!param](/FVKernels/INSFVTKESourceSink/walls) list are applied a different
treatment for production and destruction.
A different formulation is used for the `sub-laminar` and `logarithmic` boundary layers.
The determination of whether the near-wall cell lies in the laminar or logarithmic region
is performed via the non-dimensional wall distance $y^+$.
The non-dimensional wall distance is defined as

\begin{equation}
y^+ = \frac{\rho y_p u_{\tau}}{\mu} \,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $\rho$ is the density,
- $y_p$ is the distance to the wall to the centroid of the next-to-wall cell,
- $u_{\tau}$ is the friction velocity, defined as $u_{\tau} = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_w}{\rho}}$ with $\tau_w$ the shear stress at the wall for which the condition is applied,
- $\mu$ is the dynamic molecular viscosity.

For every next-to-wall cell and every iteration step, $y^+$ is found via an
incremental fixed-point search algorithm.
The cells belonging to the `sub-laminar` boundary layers are defined as those
for which $y^+ < 11.25$.
The ones belonging to the `logarithmic` boundary layer are those for which $y^+ \ge 11.25$.
The imposed threshold of $y^+ = 11.25$ is given by the value of $y^+$ at which the `sub-laminar`
and `logarithmic` boundary profiles intersect.

In the `sub-laminar` region production of turbulent kinetic energy is negligible, therefore, if $y^+ \lt 11.25$:

\begin{equation}
G_k = 0.0 \,,
\end{equation}

In the `logarithmic` boundary layers the production term is no longer negligible and is defined as:

\begin{equation}
G_k = \tau_w ||\nabla \vec{u}|| = \mu_w ||\nabla \vec{u}|| \frac{ C_{\mu}^{0.25} \sqrt(k)}{\kappa y_p} \,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $C_{\mu} = 0.09$ is a closure parameter,
- $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy,
- $||\nabla \vec{u}||$ is the near wall velocity gradient norm, which is defined as $||\nabla \vec{u}|| = (\nabla \vec{u} \cdot \hat{n}) \cdot \hat{n}$,
- $\kappa = 0.41$ is the von K치rm치n constant.

The formulation assumes that the near wall value is already imposed in the $\mu_t$ functor.

When solving a linear problem, instead of the nonlinear formulation, the production term is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
G_k =  \mu_w ||\nabla \vec{u}|| \frac{ C_{\mu}^{0.25} k}{\sqrt{k_{old}} \kappa y_p} \,.
\end{equation}

where:

- $k_{old}$ is the value of the turbulent kinetic energy in the previous iteration.

Whether the linear or nonlinear formulation is used can be controlled by the
[!param](/FVKernels/INSFVTKESourceSink/linearized_model) parameter.

For the destruction, formulation is different for the `sub-laminar` and `logarithmic` layers.
For the `sub-laminar` layer, the destruction is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{2 \mu k}{y_p ^2} \,.
\end{equation}

For the `logarithmic` layer, the destruction is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = C_{\mu}^{0.75} \frac{\rho k^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\kappa y_p} \,.
\end{equation}


## k-$\omega$-SST formulation

### Bulk formulation:

The limited turbulent production $G_k$ is modeled as:

\begin{equation}
G_k = \operatorname{min} \left( \mu_t S^2, \rho c_{pl} \beta^* \frac{k}{\omega} \right)\,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $\mu_t$ is the turbulent dynamic viscosity,
- $S$ is the shear strain tensor internal norm, defined as $S = \sqrt{2\mathbf{S}:\mathbf{S}}$ with the shear strain tensor defined as $\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{2} [\nabla \vec{u} + (\nabla \vec{u})^T]$,
- $\rho$ is the density,
- $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy,
- $\omega$ is the turbulent kintic energy specific dissipation rate,
- $c_{pl} = 10.0$ is the Durbin limiting parameter,
- $\beta^*$ is a closure parameter that is modeled different for the standard and low-Reynolds versions of the model (the low-Reynolds version of the model is activated with the [!param](/FVKernels/INSFVTKESourceSink/low_Re_modification) parameter).

*Standard formulation*:

\begin{equation}
\beta^* = F_1 \beta^*_1 + (1 - F_1) \beta^*_2\,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $F_1$ is a blending function, which should be computed using [kOmegaSSTF1BlendingAux](kOmegaSSTF1BlendingAux.md),
- $\beta^*_1 = 0.09$ and $\beta^*_2 = 0.09$ are closure parameters for the turbulent production limiting in the $k-\epsilon$ and $k-\omega$ models, respectively.

*Low-Reynolds formulation*:

\begin{equation}
\beta = F_1 \beta^*_2 \frac{4/15 + (Re_{\tau}/Re_{\beta})^4}{1.0 + (Re_{\tau}/Re_{\beta})^4} + (1 - F_1) \beta^*_2\,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $Re_{\tau} = \frac{\rho k}{\mu \omega}$ is the non-equilibrium friction Reynolds number,
- $Re_{\beta} = 8.0$ is a closure parameter for the low Reynolds limit.

The turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate $\epsilon$ is generally coming from a coupled
transport equation for $\omega$.
However, for canonical or measured cases, e.g., isotropic decaying turbulence,
the user can utilize predefined fields through functors in MOOSE.
Using $\omega$, the turbulent destruction is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \rho f_{\beta}^* \beta^* k \omega\,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $\beta^*$ is a closure parameter defined in a similar way than production, i.e., with different formulations for the standard and low-Reynolds models,
- $f_{\beta}^*$ is a dissipation function, which corrects for free shear under-dissipation in the model, this function takes a different value if the standard andf free-shear versions of the model (the free-shear version of the model is activated with the [!param](/FVKernels/INSFVTKESourceSink/free_shear_modification) parameter)

*Standard formulation*:

\begin{equation}
f_{\beta}^* = 1.0 \,,
\end{equation}

*Free-shear formulation*:

\begin{equation}
f_{\beta}^* = \frac{1 + 680 \chi_k^2}{1 + 400 \chi_k^2} \,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $\chi_k^2 = \mathbf{\chi_k} : \mathbf{\chi_k}$, is the normalized cross-diffusion, with $\mathbf{\chi_k} = \frac{\nabla k \cdot \nabla \omega}{\omega^3}$


### Wall formulation:

All cells in contact with a boundary identified in the [!param](/FVKernels/INSFVTKESourceSink/walls) list are applied a different
treatment for production and destruction.
A blended wall function is used for all $y^+$ in the $k-\omega$-SST model.
This blending is defined via a blending parameter $\Gamma$ defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = e^{-\frac{Re_k}{11}} \,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $Re_k = \frac{\rho \sqrt{k} y_p}{\mu}$ is the non-equilibrium friction Reynolds number, with $y_p$ being the ditance to the nearest wall.

Using this blending function, the production of turbulent kintic energy for the near-wall region is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
G_k = (1 - \Gamma) \mu_w ||\nabla \vec{u}|| \frac{C_{\mu}^{0.25}}{\sqrt{k} \kappa y_p} \,,
\end{equation}

where:

- $C_{\mu} = 0.09$ is a closure parameter,
- $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy,
- $||\nabla \vec{u}||$ is the near wall velocity gradient norm, which is defined as $||\nabla \vec{u}|| = (\nabla \vec{u} \cdot \hat{n}) \cdot \hat{n}$,
- $\kappa = 0.41$ is the von K치rm치n constant,
- $y_p$ is the distance to the nearest wall.

The formulation assumes that the near wall value is already imposed in the $\mu_t$ functor.
Also, note that as the ditance to the nearest wall $y_p \rightarrow 0$, the production $G_k \rightarrow 0$ thanks to the exponential term in the blending function.

The blended destruction near the wall is formulated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \Gamma \epsilon_{visc} + (1 - \Gamma) \epsilon_{log}\,.
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_{visc}$ and $\epsilon_{log}$ are the destruction in the viscous andlogarithmic layer, respectively, which are defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{visc} = \frac{6 \mu}{\beta_1 y_p^2} \,.
\end{equation}

where:

- $\beta_1 = 0.075$ is a closure parameter for the near-wall formulation.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{log} = \frac{\rho \sqrt{k}}{C_{\mu}^{0.25} \kappa y_p} \,.
\end{equation}

where:

- $C_{\mu} = 0.09$ is a closure parameter.


!alert note
When the wall treatment is specified in this kernel, any boundary condition for $k$ will be ignored.
In other words, there is no need to impose boundary conditions for $k$ when the wall treatment
is specified in his kernel.

!alert note
When using near-wall treatment, we assume that the $\mu_t$ functor is computed by an object
that performs near-wall treatment.
Otherwise, the results obtained won't not physically correct
