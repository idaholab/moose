# Navier-Stokes Module

The MOOSE Navier-Stokes module is a library for the implementation of simulation tools that solve the
Navier-Stokes equations using either the continuous Galerkin finite element
(CGFE) or finite volume (FV) methods. The Navier-Stokes
equations are usually solved using either the pressure-based, incompressible formulation (assuming a
constant fluid density), or a density-based, compressible formulation, although
there are plans to add a finite volume weakly-compressible pressured-based implementation in
the not-too-distant future.

  data to faces. A summary of limiter options can be found in
  [Limiters/index.md]

Note that the INS and INSFE kernel sets are redundant in terms of targeted
functionality. Historically, the INS kernel set was developed in this module and
the INSFE kernel set was developed in the SAM application (where there it was
prefixed with "MD") [!citep](hu2021sam). With
the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program dedicated
to consolidating fluid dynamics modeling, SAM capabilities are being migrated
upstream as appropriate into the common module layer. In the not-too-distant
future these kernel sets will be consolidated into a single set.

For an introductory slideshow on the use of the Navier Stokes Finite Volume solvers in MOOSE, we refer the visitor to the [Navier Stokes Workshop Slides](modules/navier_stokes/intro/index.md optional=True).

As Navier-Stokes Finite Volume solvers continue to evolve in MOOSE, many new solvers have been added to the Navier-Stokes module. The following table provides a summary of the readiness of different solvers and the capabilities they support. Since many of these solvers are still under active development, feel free to reach out to the MOOSE team for updates on the latest progress or follow our monthly newsletter updates.
