/**
 * This class can be used to compute a mass matrix for facet unknowns, e.g. for variables that live
 * only on element faces (these are \p SIDE_HIERARCHIC finite element family variables in libMesh).
 * This object is only executed on internal faces so in general this object should be paired with
 * MassMatrixIntegratedBC for external faces. This class cannot be used if performing static
 * condensation because static condensation relies on computing residuals and Jacobians on a strict
 * per-element basis whereas DGKernels simultaneously add residuals and Jacobians to both elements
 * on either side of the face they're currently operating on
