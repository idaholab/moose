   * testing on larger problems, even ordering optimally ordering these pieces is far too much
   * work for a single core to process. In order create a scalable algorithm, we'll first order
   * our data, then break it into complete chunks for several processors to work on concurrently.
   *
   * After sorting the data structure, it'll look something like this on some rank:
   * _partial_feature_sets (showing the unique_id and fake variable number):
   * 0     0 0 0 1 1 1 3 4 4 4 4 4 6 6 ...
   *
   * We may very well have gaps in our numbering. This is a local view on one rank.
   * We'd like to transform the data into something like the following
   * 0     0 0 0 1 1 1         <- First 3 items here (even when we don't have all features)
   * 1     3 4 4 4 4 4         <- Next 3 items here
   * 2     6 6 ...             <- Next 3 or remainder (linear partitioning)
   *
   * The way to break up this work is to simply break it into min(n_features, n_procs) chunks.
   * e.g. If we have 70 features and 8 cores, we'll partition the work into 8 chunks. In the
   * odd case where we have more processors than features (e.g. 100 processors merging 10 features),
   * we'll use end up using a subset of the available cores.
   *
   * To get all this started we just need the number of features, but we don't normally know
   * that until we've merged everything together... sigh... Wait! We can fall back on our
   * sorted data structure though and figure out before we sort and merge. We'll need
   * one more parallel communication, that won't hurt anything, right?!
