# This simulation predicts GB migration of a 2D copper polycrystal with 15 grains
# Mesh adaptivity and time step adaptivity are used
# An AuxVariable is used to calculate the grain boundary locations
# Postprocessors are used to record time step and the number of grains
# We are not using the GrainTracker in this example so the number
# of order paramaters must match the number of grains.
