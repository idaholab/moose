# CALPHAD

This is a work in progress.

A script to export MOOSE readable free energy expressions from `*.tdb`
thermodynamic database files can be found at

```text
moose/python/calphad/free_energy.py
```

The `free_energy.py` tool allows users to extract free energy expressions from
`*.tdb` thermodynamic database files (ThermoCalc format). The tool exports a
list of MOOSE Material blocks for each phase (or a user specified subset of
phases). The CALPHAD functional expressions are implemented using the
[`DerivativeParsedMaterial`](/DerivativeParsedMaterial.md) class.

It is up to the user to construct a full MOOSE input file around these material
blocks and to rename the variables used in the exported form to more suitable
names.

## Installation

The [pycalphad](https://github.com/richardotis/pycalphad) Python module is
required to perform the parsing of the `*.tdb` files.
[SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) is required to build the functional
forms of the calphad expressions.

### conda installation

If you are using the MOOSE conda/mamba environment it is best to create a
dedicated pycalphad environment:

```
mamba create -n pycalphad pycalphad sympy jupyterlab
mamba activate pycalphad
```

`jupyterlab` is optional for viewing the example notebook under `moose/modules/phase_field/examples/slkks`.

Then you can install pycalphad and fparser from conda-forge:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pycalphad
conda install -c conda-forge fparser
```
Make sure you put the `free_energy.py` and the `*.tdb` in the same directory, and then you can run this code and get the results:

```
python free_energy.py *.tdb
```

### pip Installation

To install and/or upgrade these prerequisites using pip:

```text
pip install --upgrade sympy
pip install --upgrade pycalphad
```


## Thermodynamic databases

Database files can be obtained online at

* [Computational Phase Diagram Database](http://cpddb.nims.go.jp/index_en.html) (CPDDB)
* [Thermodynamic Database Database](https://avdwgroup.engin.brown.edu/) (TDBDB)
