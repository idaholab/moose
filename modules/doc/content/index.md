### Rapid Development class=center style=font-weight:200;

MOOSE is a finite-element framework that aids in application development by harnessing
state-of-the-art fully-coupled, fully-implicit multiphysics solvers while providing automatic
parallelization, mesh adaptivity, and a growing set of physics modules.

### User Focused class=center style=font-weight:200;

MOOSE includes ever-expanding set of physics modules including solid mechanics, phase-field,
Navier-Stokes, and heat conduction. MOOSE supports multi-scale models allowing linking of
MOOSE-based applications, enabling collaboration across applications, time-scales, and spatial
domains.
