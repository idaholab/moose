Sockeye is a heat pipe analysis application geared towards heat pipes of interest in heat-pipe-cooled microreactors. Sockeye provides various transient heat pipe modeling capabilities, including a 1D, two-phase flow model and a 2D effective thermal conductivity model based on heat conduction, which leverages analytic expressions of operational limits.
