# NCRC Applications and Remote Access

The NCRC manages a wide range of applications and access to those applications to meet
the needs of researchers around the world. Please follow the instructions for the level
of access granted to you.

- [Level 1 - HPC OnDemand Execution](ncrc_ondemand.md)
- [Level 1 - Execution while on INL HPC systems](help/inl/hpc_binary.md)
- [Level 2 - Local Binary Installation](ncrc_local_binary.md)
- [Level 4 - Source Repository Access](ncrc_repository.md)


## Requesting Access id=access

NCRC applications may be obtained by outside institutions and individuals for execution and/or development. Currently, the following access methods are available for certain applications.

- +HPC Binary Access+\\
  Users in the category will be provided an INL-HPC account that includes a binary version of
  the desired application ready for use on INL-HPC resources.

- +Binary Access+ (Coming soon)\\
  Users in this category will be provided with access to a binary version of the desired
  application that is executable on non-INL systems, such as a personal workstation or institution
  cluster.

- +Source Code Access+\\
  Users in this category will be provided with complete source code access to an application. This
  level of access is reserved for individuals that will be developing new capabilities for the
  application and contributing directly to the project.


!alert note
The site handling access requests, is currently transitioning to a new location.

## HPC OnDemand id=gen_ondemand

HPC OnDemand is a service provided by the INL, which allows a user direct access to the resources contained within the HPC enclave via their web browser. This is the recommended way to access INL HPC resources for most users. For general information on using INL HPC OnDemand [go here](gen_ondemand.md), specific information on using OnDemand for running simulations can be found in the Level 1 access instructions above.
