## How do I build and use my own libMesh? id=libmesh-myown

libMesh is supplied by our Conda installation. However, if you wish to build and use your own libMesh installation, you can use our
`update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh` script.

Due to having moose-libmesh installed, Conda creates and sets an influential environment variable LIBMESH_DIR that you would have to continually `unset`. It is therefore advisable to create a new Conda environment without moose-libmesh installed:

```bash
conda create -n custom-libmesh moose-petsc moose-tools --channel https://conda.software.inl.gov/public
conda activate custom-libmesh
cd ~/projects/moose/scripts
./update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh
```

The above creates a new Conda environment: 'custom-libmesh', installs the needed PETSc dependency so we can build our own libMesh, activates it, and then builds libMesh.
