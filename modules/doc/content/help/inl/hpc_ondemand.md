# HPC OnDemand

[HPC OnDemand](https://hpcondemand.inl.gov/pun/sys/dashboard), is a service provided by INL which
allows a user direct access to the resources contained within the HPC enclave via their web browser.
In order to utilize this service, you must first [request an account](https://inl.gov/ncrc).

Once your request has been accepted, and you have been given the necessary credentials provided by
the HPC team, head on over to [HPC OnDemand](https://hpcondemand.inl.gov/pun/sys/dashboard).

### Dashboard

The Dashboard is your homepage when using HPC OnDemand. It will be the first page you see, after you
log in.

The following represents some of the more useful features, and is not an exhaustive list:

- Files, Home Directory

  - This will launch a "File Explorer" web browser tab.
    File Explorer is your GUI access to the files contained within your home directory. From here,
    you can perform just about any file operation normally achieved as if browsing your files using
    a native file explorer. File Explorer will also allow you to download and upload files to and
    from your machine.

- Jobs, Job Composer

  - Launches a new browser tab allowing you to schedule a new job to be run on one of [!ac](INL)'s
   [!ac](HPC) machines.

- Clusters, * Shell Access

  - Launches a new browser tab granting an interactive shell prompt to the [!ac](HPC) machine
   selected. The interactive shell will be one of the more useful tools when needing direct access
   to things like: launching PBS/Slurm jobs manually, building MOOSE, running tests, and more.

- Interactive Apps, Linux Desktop / Linux Deskop with Visualization

  - Launches a new browser tab allowing you to schedule an interactive session to one of
   [!ac](INL)'s [!ac](HPC) visualization machines. Once the session begins, clicking on "Launch
   Linux Desktop" will launch another tab, connecting your browser to the virtual machine. You can
   safely close this "VNC" tab without quiting your scheduled visualization session.
