# Classes and Object Oriented Programming



## Object Oriented Definitions

- A class is a new data type
- Contains data and methods for operating on that data

  - You can think of it as a "blue print" for building an object

- An "interface" is defined as a class's publicly available "methods" and "data"
- An "instance" is a variable of one of these new data types

  - Also known as an "object"
  - Analogy: You can use one "blue print" to build many buildings. You can use one "class" to build many "objects"



## Object Oriented Design

- Instead of manipulating data, one manipulates objects that have defined interfaces
- Data encapsulation is the idea that objects or new types should be black boxes. Implementation details are unimportant as long as an object works as advertised without side effects.
- Inheritance gives us the ability to abstract or "factor out" common data and functions out of related types into a single location for consistency (avoids code duplication) and enables *code re-use*.
- Polymorphism gives us the ability to write *generic algorithms* that automatically work with derived types.



## Encapsulation (Point.h)

```cpp
class Point
{
public:
  // Constructor
  Point(float x, float y);
  // Accessors
  float getX();
  float getY();
  void setX(float x);
  void setY(float y);
private:
  float _x, _y;
};
```



## Constructors

- The method that is called explicitly or implicitly to build an object
- Always has the same name as the class with no return type
- May have many overloaded versions with different parameters
- The constructor body uses a special syntax for initialization called an initialization list
- Every member that can be initialized in the initialized list should be

  - References have to be initialized here

```cpp
Point::Point(float x, float y) :
 // Point has no base class, if it did, it
 // would need to be constructed first
 _x(x),
 _y(y)
{}  // The body is often empty
```



## Point Class Definitions (Point.C)

```cpp
#include "Point.h"

Point::Point(float x, float y): _x(x), _y(y) { }
float Point::getX() { return _x; }
float Point::getY() { return _y; }
void Point::setX(float x) { _x = x; }
void Point::setY(float y) { _y = y; }
```

This data is safely encapsulated so we can change the implementation without affecting users of this type.



## Changing the implementation (Point.h)

```cpp
class Point
{
public:
  Point(float x, float y);
  float getX();
  float getY();
  void setX(float x);
  void setY(float y);
private:
  // Store a vector of values rather than separate scalars
  std::vector<float> _coords;
};
```



## New Point Class Body (Point.C)

```cpp
#include "Point.h"
Point::Point(float x, float y)
{
  _coords.push_back(x);
  _coords.push_back(y);
}

float Point::getX() { return _coords[0]; }
float Point::getY() { return _coords[1]; }
void Point::setX(float x) { _coords[0] = x; }
void Point::setY(float y) { _coords[1] = y; }
```



## Using the Point Class (main.C)

```cpp
#include "Point.h"
int main()
{
  Point p1(1, 2);
  Point p2 = Point(3, 4);
  Point p3; // compile error, no default constructor
  std::cout << p1.getX() << "," << p1.getY() << "\n"
            << p2.getX() << "," << p2.getY() << "\n";
}
```



## Operator Overloading

- For some user-defined types (objects) it makes sense to use built-in operators to perform functions with those types.
- For example, without operator overloading, adding the coordinates of two points and assigning the result to a third object might be performed like this:

```cpp
Point a(1,2), b(3,4), c(5,6);
// Assign c = a + b using accessors
c.setX(a.getX() + b.getX());
c.setY(a.getY() + b.getY());
```

- However, the ability to reuse existing operators on new types makes the following possible:

```cpp
c = a + b;
```



## Operator Overloading

Inside our Point class, we define new member functions with the special operator keyword:

```cpp
Point Point::operator+(const Point & p)
{
  return Point(_x + p._x, _y + p._y);
}

Point & Point::operator=(const Point & p)
{
  _x = p._x;
  _y = p._y;
  return *this;
}
```



## Using "Point" with Operators

```cpp
#include "Point.h"

int main()
{
  Point p1(0, 0), p2(1, 2), p3(3, 4);
  p1 = p2 + p3;
  std::cout << p1.getX() << "," << p1.getY() << "\n";
}
```



## A more Advanced Example (Shape.h)

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
  Shape(int x=0, int y=0): _x(x), _y(y) {}  // Constructor
  virtual ~Shape() {} // Destructor
  virtual float area()=0;  // Pure Virtual Function
  void printPosition();    // Body appears elsewhere

protected:
  // Coordinates at the centroid of the shape
  int _x;
  int _y;
};
```



## The Derived Classes (Rectangle.h)

```cpp
#include "Shape.h"
class Rectangle: public Shape
{
public:
  Rectangle(int width, int height, int x=0, int y=0) :
    Shape(x,y),
    _width(width),
    _height(height)
  {}

  virtual ~Rectangle() {}

  virtual float area() { return _width * _height; }

protected:
  int _width;
  int _height;
};
```



## The derived Classes (Circle.h)

```cpp
#include "Shape.h"
class Circle: public Shape
{
public:
  Circle(int radius, int x=0, int y=0) :
    Shape(x,y), 
    _radius(radius) 
  {}

  virtual ~Circle() {}

  virtual float area() { return PI * _radius * _radius; }
protected:
  int _radius;
  const double PI = 3.14159265359;
};
```



## Inheritance (Is a ...)

- When using inheritance, the derived class can be described in terms of the base class

  - A Rectangle "is a" Shape

- Derived classes are "type' compatible with the base class (or any of is ancestors)

  - We can use a base class variable to point or refer to an instance of the derived class

```cpp
Rectangle rectangle(3, 4);
Shape & s_ref = rectangle;
Shape * s_ptr = &rectangle;
```



## Deciphering Long Declarations

Read the declaration from right to left

```cpp
// mesh is a pointer to a Mesh object
Mesh * mesh; 

// params is a reference to an InputParameters object
InputParameters & params; 
```



## Writing a Generic Algorithm

```cpp
// create a couple of shapes
Rectangle r(3, 4);
Circle c(3, 10, 10);
printInformation(r);   // pass a Rectangle into a Shape reference
printInformation(c);   // pass a Circle into a Shape reference
...
void printInformation(const Shape & shape)
{
  shape.printPosition();
  std::cout << shape.area() << '\n';
}
// (0, 0)
// 12
// (10, 10)
// 28.274
```



## Homework Ideas

1. Implement a new Shape called Square. Try deriving from Rectangle directly instead of Shape. What advantages/disadvantages do the two designs have?
1. Implement a Triangle shape. What interesting subclasses of Triangle can you imagine?
1. Add another constructor to the Rectangle class that accepts coordinates instead of height and width.
