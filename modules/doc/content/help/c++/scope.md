# Scope, Memory and Overloading



## Scope

- A scope is the extent of the program where a variable can be seen and used.

  - Local variables have scope from the point of declaration to the end of the enclosing block {}
  - Global variables are not enclosed within any scope and are available within the entire file

- Variables have a lifetime
- When a variable goes out of scope, its destructor is called
- Dynamically-allocated (via new) memory *is not* automatically freed at the end of the scope



## "Named" Scopes

- class scope

  ```cpp
  class MyObject
  {
  public:
    void myMethod();
  };
  ```

- namespace scope

  ```cpp
  namespace MyNamespace
  {
    float a;
    void myMethod();
  }
  ```



## Scope Resolution Operator

- "double colon" :: is used to refer to members inside of a named scope

  ```cpp
  // definition of the "myMethod" function of "MyObject"
  void MyObject::myMethod()
  {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
  }
  MyNamespace::a = 2.718;
  MyNamespace::myMethod();
  ```

- Namespaces permit data organization, but do not have all the features needed for full encapsulation Assignment (Prequel to Pointers and Refs)
- Recall that assignment in C++ uses the "single equals" operator:

  ```cpp
  a = b; // Assignment
  ```
  
- Assignments are one of the most common operations in programming
- Two operands are required

  - An assignable location on the left hand side (memory location)
  - An expression on the right hand side



## Pointers

- Pointers are a native type just like an int or long
- Pointers hold the location of another variable or object in memory
- Pointers are useful in avoiding expensive copies of large objects

  - Ex : Functions are passed pointers to large objects, rather than the objects themselves

- Pointers also facilitate shared memory

  - Ex : one object "owns" the memory associated with some data, and allows other objects access through a pointer



## Pointer Syntax

- Declare a pointer

  ```cpp
  int *p;
  ```
  
- Use the "address-of" operator to initialize a pointer

  ```cpp
  int a;
  p = &a;
  ```
  
- Use the "dereference" operator to get or set values pointed-to by the pointer

  ```cpp
  *p = 5;                  // set value of "a" through "p"
  std::cout << *p << "\n"; // prints 5
  std::cout <<  a << "\n"; // prints 5
  ```

  ```cpp
  int a = 5;
  int *p;       // declare a pointer
  p = &a;       // set 'p' equal to address of 'a'
  *p = *p + 2;  // get value pointed to by 'p', add 2,
                // store result in same location
  std::cout <<  a << "\n";  // prints 7
  std::cout << *p << "\n";  // prints 7
  std::cout <<  p << "\n";  // prints an address (0x7fff5fbfe95c)
  ```



## Pointers are Powerful but Unsafe

- On the previous slide we had this:

  ```cpp
  p = &a;
  ```
- But we can do almost anything we want with p!

  ```cpp
  p = p + 1000;
  ```
  
- Now what happens when we do this?

  ```cpp
  *p;    // Access memory at &a + 1000
  ```



## References to the Rescue

- A reference is an alternative name for an object (Think of it as an alias for the original variable)

```cpp
int a = 5;
int &r = a;  // define and initialize a ref
r = r + 2;
std::cout <<  a << "\n";  // prints 7
std::cout <<  r << "\n";  // prints 7
std::cout << &r << "\n";  // prints address of a
```



## References are Safe

- References cannot be modified

  ```cpp
  &r = &r + 1;   // won't compile
  ```
  
- References never start out un-initialized

  ```cpp
  int &r;     // won't compile
  ```
  
- Note that class declarations may contain references
- If so, initialization must occur in the constructor!
- We will see an example later on...



## Summary : Pointers and References

- A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address to another variable

  ```cpp
  int *iPtr;  // Declaration
  iPtr = &c;
  int a = b + *iPtr;
  ```

- A reference is an alternative name for an object

  - Cannot create a reference without existing object

  ```cpp
  int &iRef = c;    // Must initialize
  int a = b + iRef;
  ```



## Calling Conventions

- What happens when you make a function call

```cpp
result = someFunction(a, b,my_shape);
```

- If the function changes the values inside of a, b or my_shape, are those changes reflected in my code ?
- Is this call expensive ? (Are arguments copied around ?)
- C++ by default is "Pass by Value" (copy) but you can pass arguments by reference (alias) with additional syntax



## Swap Example (Pass by Value)

```cpp
void swap(int a, int b)
{
  int temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}
int i = 1;
int j = 2;
swap (i, j);                  // i and j are arguments
std::cout << i << " " << j;   // prints 1 2
                              // i and j are not swapped

```



## Swap Example (Pass by Reference)

```cpp
void swap(int &a, int &b)
{
  int temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}
int i = 1;
int j = 2;
swap (i, j);                  // i and j are arguments
std::cout << i << " " << j;   // prints 2 1
                              // i and j are properly swapped

```



## Dynamic Memory Allocation

Why do we need dynamic memory allocation?

- Data size specified at run time (rather than compile time)
- Persistence without global variables (scopes)
- Efficient use of space
- Flexibility



## Dynamic Memory in C++

- "new" allocates memory
- "delete" frees memory
- Recall that variables typically have limited lifetimes (within the nearest enclosing scope)
- Dynamic memory allocation do not have limited lifetimes

  - No automatic memory cleanup!
  - Watch out for memory leaks
  - Should have a "delete" for every "new"

- During normal usage, dynamic memory allocation is unnecessary



## Example: Dynamic Memory

```cpp
int a;
int *b;
b = new int; // dynamic allocation, what is b's value?
a = 4;
*b = 5;
int c = a + *b;
std::cout << c;  // prints 9
delete b;
```



## Example: Dynamic Memory Using References

```cpp
int a;
int *b = new int;    // dynamic allocation
int &r = *b;         // creating a reference to newly created variable
a = 4;
r = 5;
int c = a + r;
std::cout << c;  // prints 9
delete b;
```



## Const

- The const keyword is used to mark a variable, parameter, method or other argument as constant.
- Typically used with references and pointers to share objects but guarantee that they will not be modified

```cpp
{
  std::string name("myObject");
  print(name);
  ...
}
void print(const std::string & name)
{
  // Attempting to modify name here will
  // cause a compile time error
  ...
}
```



## Function Overloading

In C++ you may reuse function names as long as they have different parameter lists or types. A difference only in the return type is not enough to differentiate overload signatures.

```cpp
int foo(int value);
int foo(float value);
int foo(float value, bool is_initialized);
...
```

This is very useful when we get to object "constructors".
