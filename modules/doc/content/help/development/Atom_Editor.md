# Setup Atom Editor for MOOSE

!alert warning
The Atom project will be [sunsetted on December 15th, 2022](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).
Please transition to a different editor. Many MOOSE team members and most application developers have
migrated to [VSCode](VSCode.md), and we offer an extension for MOOSE development that now exceeds the
capabilities of the corresponding Atom plugins.

[Atom](http://atom.io) is a text editor developed by GitHub with a flexible plugin structure. Several
plugins are available to customize Atom for MOOSE development, some specifically developed for MOOSE.

## Setting up Atom

Installation packages can be downloaded for Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems from the
[Atom website](http://atom.io). The editor has an automatic update system for both the core editor as
well as the installed plugins.

### First Steps

- +Start Atom+ for the first time and select _Atom->Install Shell Commands_. This activates the
  `atom` and `apm` shell commands for use from a terminal.
- +Close Atom+. From now on we will only start it from our MOOSE project directories using `atom`
  ensuring that Atom sees the full MOOSE build environment.

## Important commands

- +Cmd-Shift-P+ opens the command palette. Every available Atom command can be accessed by typing a
  few letters here. The dropdown list shows the keyboard shortcuts.
- +Cmd-T+ opens a file anywhere in the current project tree (i.e. below the directory in which you
  issued the `atom .` command. No need to know the precise path or even the precise spelling of the
  filename!

## Plugins

Tip: To install a plugin, use the "apm" command on your terminal:

```bash
apm install switch-header-source
```

The following plugins should be installed to effectively develop MOOSE based codes and edit MOOSE
input files using Atom

- [switch-header-source](http://atom.io/packages/switch-header-source): Use +Ctrl-Alt-S+ to switch
  between corresponding header and source files.
- [language-moose](http://atom.io/packages/language-moose): Syntax highlighting and automatic
  indentation for MOOSE input files, C++ [code snippets](./Snippets) for all MOOSE systems, and
  highlighting of select MOOSE C++ types.
- [autocomplete-moose](http://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-moose): Context sensitive autocompletion
  for MOOSE input files.
- [make-runner](http://atom.io/packages/make-runner): Press +Ctrl-R+ to build the current project
  from within Atom. Features clickable compile error messages to jump straight to the locations with
  the compile errors.
- [autocomplete-clang](http://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-clang): Type-aware C++
  autocompletion. Use ```make clang_complete``` in your project directory to generate the necessary
  configuration file.
- [clang-format](http://atom.io/packages/clang-format): Uses clang-format with the custom MOOSE style
  rules to format your code. Can be set to reformat automatically when saving or manually by pressing
  +Cmd-Shift-K+.
- [atomic-rtags](http://atom.io/packages/atomic-rtags): uses the rtags demon (live indexing of the
  C++ symbols in your source tree) to provide a _jump to declaration_ feature. See below how to
  set-up rtags with MOOSE

### Recommended settings

- In the *whitespace* core package (Settings->Packages search for 'whitespace') deactivate *Ignore
  Whitespace On Current Line*.

## Source navigation with [rtags](https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags)

Download and build rtags. In order to configure and build rtags, `llvm-config`
and some other llvm and clang development tools will need to be available in
your environment. To obtain the necessary tools, in your MOOSE conda environment, perform:

```bash
conda install moose-libmesh moose-tools llvmdev clangdev --channel https://conda.software.inl.gov/public
```

Note that though the relevant packages are `llvmdev` and `clangdev`, specifying
the MOOSE packages (`moose-libmesh` and `moose-tools` in this example) may be
necessary in order to prevent downgrading of those package versions. After
installing `llvmdev` and `clangdev`, we can proceed to building and installing rtags:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags.git
cd rtags/
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir mybuild && cd mybuild
cmake ..
make -j 24
sudo make install
```

Start the rtags demon in a separate terminal

```bash
rdm
```

Leave that terminal open in the background and get back to your old terminal.
Then change into your application directory (or `moose/modules`) and run

```bash
MOOSE_UNITY=false make compile_commands.json && rc -J .
```

This will cause make to transmit a list of all compile commands to the rtags demon. The rtags demon
will immediately start indexing all MOOSE source code files (you can observe the process in the rdm
terminal window).

You can now press `alt+,` in Atom with the cursor on any symbol (even macros) to jump to its
declaration courtesy of the _atomic-rtags_ package.

### Using Atom behind a proxy

To enable update checking and plugin installation proxy information must be entered in a
configuration file at `~/.atom/.apmrc` (create the file as needed) as

```text
proxy = http://server:port
http-proxy = http://server:port
http_proxy = http://server:port
https_proxy = http://server:port
```
