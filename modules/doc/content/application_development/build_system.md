# MOOSE Build System

## Overview

!style halign=left
The MOOSE build system is a hierarchical Makefile based system. The idea is that no matter where
you are in the hierarchy of MOOSE applications/modules/framework, simply typing `make` will rebuild
everything that needs to be rebuilt. The basic way to build any MOOSE application is simply to do
a:

```bash
make
```

within the application directory.

Consider an application named `Frog` that depends on two of the physics modules `solid_mechanics`
and `heat_transfer`.  Typing `make` within the `frog` directory will automatically build
`framework`, `solid_mechanics`, `heat_transfer` and `frog`.

In addition, the Makefiles in the MOOSE system are designed for parallel building.  Using the `-j`
flag when running `make` will allow you to build much faster. For instance, if you have 8
processors in your workstation you can do:

```bash
make -j 8
```

This will cause `make` to spawn 8 compilation processes at the same time, compiling up to 8x faster
than a serial compile.

## Environment Variables

!style halign=left
The MOOSE build system relies on environment variables for control over the build process. Here are
some of the environment variables you can set and their effects:

- `METHOD`: Set this to `opt`, `dbg`, `oprof` or `devel` to build executables with differing amounts
  of optimization and debugging capabilities.  See the Method section below for more information.
- `METHODS`: A set of space separated `METHOD` options.  This should enumerate all of the ways you
  ever want to set `METHOD`
- `MOOSE_DIR`: _Optional_.  The directory where the MOOSE repository is.  Usually the Makefile can
  find it unless you have very non-standard paths.
- `MOOSE_UNITY`: defaults to `true`, set to `false` to turn off unity builds.  For more information
  see the Build System Optimization section below.
- `MOOSE_HEADER_SYMLINKS`: defaults to `true`, set to `false` to turn off header symlinking. This is
  an advanced option and there are very few reasons to disable this. You will likely notice a
  dramatic slowdown if you set this to false.

## Build Methods

!style halign=left
As mentioned above there are two environment variables that control what "type" of executable gets
created: `METHOD` and `METHODS`.  The executable that is ultimately created will have the `$METHOD`
as a suffix like: `something-$METHOD`. The valid options are:

- `opt`: (The default) Builds an optimized executable suitable for running calculations.
- `dbg`: An executable meant for use in a debugger (like `gdb` or `lldb`).  Will be very slow and
  not meant to be used on large problems
- `devel`: Something in-between `opt` and `dbg`.  Attempts to be faster but also does some more
  run-time checks (asserts and mooseAsserts)
- `oprof`: Not normally used.  Can be used for "code profiling": running your code with a utility
  like `oprof`, `gprof`, `vtune`, etc.

`METHODS` is used to specify the full set (space separated) of the above options that you will
 _ever_ want to used.  It is used in the build of `libMesh` to build a `libMesh` library for each of
 the `METHODS`, so that a rebuild of `libMesh` is not required for every rebuild of MOOSE.

## Build Optimization

!alert! note
This is advanced information meant to inform you of optimizations that happen within the MOOSE build
system. This is not necessary to understand how to use and build MOOSE.
!alert-end!

There are two main build optimizations: "header symlinking" and "unity builds":

### Header Symlinking

!style halign=left
MOOSE and MOOSE-based applications include directories are organized into sub-directories for each
system (such as `kernels`, `bcs`, `auxkernels`, etc.). There are currently ~70 different MOOSE
systems, meaning that each application could potentially have 70+ directories to search for include
files. In addition, applications can compose/use each other and use the physics modules. Each time
you add another application/module, you're gaining another 70+ include directories.

This can lead to an "explosion" of include directory paths (application + 4 modules + framework =\
420 paths!). This expansion of paths can lead to the compiler slowing down as each path needs to be
searched at compile time to find a header.

To combat this, during the build phase a directory named `build/header_symlinks` is created for each
application/module. All of the header files within that application/module are then symlinked into
that directory. This means that each application/module you add only adds _one_ include directory
instead of 70), greatly speeding up the compilation process.

### Unity Builds

!style halign=left
Within the subdirectories underneath the `src` directory of a typical MOOSE-based application you
will find definitions of multiple, closely-related objects in `.C` files.  For instance in
`src/kernels` you would be likely to find 10-15 Kernels that all inherit from `Kernel.h`.  However,
if we were to compile all of these files separately (as is commonly done) each of the `#include`
trees would have to be found and compiled for each one of these files individually. In addition,
each of these `.C` files would create a separate `.o` file that would ultimately need to be linked
into the final library / application.

A different idea is to compile all of these files together as one file, providing considerable
savings for evaluating the `#include`s and ultimately just producing _one_ `.o` file to be linked.
This is known as a "unity build" and can provide a huge savings in compile time. The following is
showing timing for `make -j 16` for various sets of applications/modules/framework on the [!ac](INL)
[!ac](HPC) Falcon supercomputer (now decommissioned). It is plain to see how much time is saved by
using both header symlinking and unity builds.

        style=width:50%;float:right;margin-left:20px;
       caption=Compile speed on Falcon.

The way we achieve a unity build in MOOSE is by compiling multiple `.C` files together by createing
a `.C` file that `#include`s all of the other `.C` files. In MOOSE this happens in a directory
called `build/unity_src` in each application / module.

By default this behavior is +on+. To turn it off you can set `MOOSE_UNITY=false` in your
environment.  Further, an application can disable it permanently by putting `MOOSE_UNITY := false`
at the top of their Makefile.

In addition, you can also choose to avoid using a unity build for individual directories within your
project. By default `src` and `src/base` are not built this way because they generally contain a mix
of objects that don't benefit from being built simultaneously. To add to that list, set the
`app_non_unity_dirs` variable in your `Makefile` before the `include` of `app.mk` like so:

```
app_non_unity_dirs = %/src/contrib/third_party_code %/src/contrib/other_non_unity_dir

include            $(FRAMEWORK_DIR)/app.mk
```

Make sure to prepend your directories with a `%` sign.

### Revision Generation

!style halign=left
The build process can generate C++ header files containing repository versioning information for use
within your application. These header files are generated by default but can be disabled by setting
a `Make` variable in your application's `Makefile`:

```
# must be set before the app.mk file is included
GEN_REVISION := no
include      $(FRAMEWORK_DIR)/app.mk
```

The Revision file contains both a version string (git hash) and a revision string containing more
detailed information or tagged information. Note that the name of your app will appear instead of
"MOOSE" for your individual application:

```
/* THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED - DO NOT EDIT */

#ifndef MOOSE_REVISION_H
#define MOOSE_REVISION_H

#define MOOSE_REVISION "git commit f4abb66afa on 2018-03-07"
#define MOOSE_VERSION "f4abb66afa"

#endif // MOOSE_REVISION_H
```

## MOOSE's build system

!style halign=left
MOOSE uses the tried and true UNIX standard build tools,
[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and
[GNU Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/). These tools are ubiquitous, reliable, and
stable, where many other build systems are not. We believe that usability of a tool includes the
build process as well as the run-time experience and that philosophy shows in the way we've
structured the Makefiles for building MOOSE-based applications.

MOOSE now includes a standard `configure` script for changing select configuration options in MOOSE
and for finding optional libraries only necessary within MOOSE (not libMesh). If you find yourself
needing to add a new library or new variable the best way to learn is to look at what we already
have and go from there.

!alert note
It's important to remember that running configure in MOOSE is completely optional. This is to
maintain the status quo of not changing the developer workflow since MOOSE has historically not had
a configure script. Additionally it means that users building a MOOSE-based applications will not
have to go into the framework directory to run configure prior to building their application.

### Building GNU Autotools

!style halign=left
In general, we recommend that you do not install the GNU Autotools from your package manager. The
reason for this is that different versions of the tools can make drastic changes to the generated
outputs. libMesh has solved this problem by distributing the GNU Autotools with its source. To build
libMesh's autotools, simply change directory into libMesh's root (normally `moose/libmesh`) and run
the bootstrap script. This will build and install the autotools into libMesh's contrib directory:

```
moose/libmesh/contrib/autotools/bin
```

You'll probably want to add the path above to your PATH.

### Adding a new C-Preprocessor variable in MooseConfig.h

!style halign=left
To add a new variable to `MooseConfig.h`, you'll first want to add the variable to configure.ac
using one of the variable definition macros such as "AC_DEFINE". After that, you'll run `autoheader`
followed by `autoconf`.

### Adding a new "make" variable

!style halign=left
If you want to add an optional dependency to MOOSE that isn't already being handled by the libMesh
build system, you'll want likely want to use the "AC_SUBST" macros after adding the appropriate
logic to define those variables. You'll then edit the `conf_var.mk.in` file. Note: Since MOOSE
doesn't use automake, we don't generate a complete Makefile from running configure, rather we just
optionally include "conf_var.mk" into our normal Makefile when it exists. This makes it so that
running "configure" is an optional step when building MOOSE or a MOOSE-based application.

### File list

- `framework/configure.ac` - This is the input file that is processed by `autoconf` to create the
  configure script. If you modify this file you will need to rerun `autoconf` to regenerate the
  `configure` script. If you defined a new variable (e.g. with AC_DEFINE), you will need to run
  `autoheader` then `autoconf`.

- `framework/include/base/MooseConfig.h.in` - This file is auto-generated from running `autoheader`.

- `framework/conf_vars.mk.in` - This file is where you put your new expansion expressions. Typically
  these are in the form of "@VARIABLE@".

### Make Install

!style halign=left
MOOSE's build system has the ability to create installed binaries suitable for use with the conda
package manager, or installation on a shared computing resource such as Sawtooth. The `install`
target will copy the binary, and required libraries to a file tree based on the prefix you
configured with (set by the variable `PREFIX` or the `--prefix` argument).

```bash
cd moose
./configure --prefix=<installation path>
cd <application_dir>
make [make options]
make install
```

Additionally each application may wish to make an one or more file structures available for
end-users to install into their own environment. This allows for end-users to install and run the
application test suite, examples, tutorials, or other inputs of interest. To customize what is
available for installation, the application developer will define the list of source directories
that can be installed by end users in their application Makefile. For example:

```bash
INSTALLABLE_DIRS := tests examples tutorials
```

!style! style=position:relative;top:-15px;left:5px;font-style:italic;font-size:small;
These paths should all be relative to the root of the application.
!style-end!


To give application developers the ability to customize the layout of the installed directories it's
possible to specify the destination path as well by using a "key/value" syntax. For example:

```bash
INSTALLABLE_DIRS := test/tests->tests examples/01->example_01 examples/02->example_02 tutorials
```

In this case, if the user chooses to install each of these directories into a writable workspace the
resulting directory structure will look like this:

```bash
$ ls -l
tests  example_01  example_02  tutorials
```

!alert! warning
Make sure that installed paths do not include source code. This could result in an accidental export
of information for those cleared for only binary access.
!alert-end!

### Copying and Running Installed Inputs

!style halign=left
Once an application has been installed, end users that have access to those binaries can install or
copy those paths to their home directories and also run the tests with the MOOSE TestHarness using
convenient command line parameters.

Example:

```bash
cd <user writable location>
export PATH=$PATH:<prefix>/bin       # See instructions for HPC computers below

bison-opt --copy-inputs <directory>  # e.g. from the INSTALLABLE_DIRS example above:
                                     # tests, example_01, example_02, tutorials, etc.

cd <directory>                       # where <directory> will be printed on the screen
                                     # likely: `cd ./app_name/tests`

bison-opt --run -j8                  # Note: Command line parameters appearing after
                                     # --run are passed to the TestHarness
```

For a complete list of the directories that may be copied use the `--show-copyable-inputs` flag:

```bash
bison-opt --show-copyable-inputs
```
