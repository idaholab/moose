# Software Quality

!alert construction
The software quality documents as well as the system to create them is under heavy development, this
page will be expanding shortly to include more information about the software quality standards
employed by MOOSE.

Within MOOSE, code reliability is paramount, so MOOSE employs a rigorous and well-documented
development strategy.  In order to accomplish this task, a comprehensive set of tools for testing and
documentation are being developed continuously and included within the framework for use by
application developers.

In particular, testing of both MOOSE and MOOSE-based applications is of primary importance; changes
are only merged into the framework once manual code review and the automated tests have ensured the
changes are compatible with the applications. Since MOOSE is an open-source project, the testing
process is publicly available at [www.moosebuild.org](http://www.moosebuild.org).

MOOSE is developed by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) by a team of computer scientists and
engineers and is supported by various funding agencies including the
[United States Department of Energy](http://energy.gov/). Development is ongoing at INL and by
collaborators throughout the world.

The software quality documents for MOOSE are listed below:

- [System Requirement Specification (SRS)](sqa/moose_srs.md)
- [System Design Description (SDD)](sqa/moose_sdd.md)
- [Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)](sqa/moose_rtm.md)
- [Verification and Validation Report](sqa/moose_v_and_v.md)
