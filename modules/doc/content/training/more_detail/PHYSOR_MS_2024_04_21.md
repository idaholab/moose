#### Course Description

!style! halign=left
The goal of the training session is to gain familiarity modeling the running-in phase of pebble bed
reactors (PBRs) with the MOOSE-based tools Griffin and Pronghorn. Griffin includes capabilities for
neutronics and depletion calculations and provides power densities to Pronghorn. Pronghorn uses the
power densities to calculate temperatures using a porous medium flow model and user input
thermal-hydraulic conditions as well as simplified models for the pebble bed reactor structures.
Griffin can use pregenerated multigroup libraries for cross sections or a new feature that enables
using its own cross sections generated online. This workshop will provide hands-on exercises for
online cross section generation, run-in phase modeling with Griffin, thermal-hydraulics modeling
with Pronghorn, and multiphysics running-in modeling including a control rod withdrawal event from
a non- equilibrium core.
