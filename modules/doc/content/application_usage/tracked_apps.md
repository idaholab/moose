# Tracked Apps

MOOSE is designed for building custom applications, the following is a community driven list of applications.

The purpose of these lists is two fold:

1. Every MOOSE-based application is a library, thus it is natural to create new applications from existing code.
1. The MOOSE developers strive to keep your applications up-to-date when major changes occur, this list indicates to the developers to consider your application.
