## MOOSE Improvements

### UserObject and Postprocessor support in Kokkos-MOOSE

Kokkos-MOOSE now supports GPU-based [UserObjects](syntax/KokkosUserObjects/index.md) and [Postprocessors](syntax/KokkosUserObjects/index.md#reducers). Kokkos-MOOSE postprocessors leverage the reducer concept of Kokkos and have substantially different interface from the original MOOSE postprocessors. The Kokkos-MOOSE `VectorPostprocessors` and `Reporters` will also adopt the same reducer interface and be added soon. See the linked document for details.
