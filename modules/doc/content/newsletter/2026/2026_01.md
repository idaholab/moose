## MOOSE Improvements

- Added the option to pass command line arguments to all `RunApp` testers in the `TestHarness`, via `--append-runapp-cliarg` ((idaholab/moose#31935)[https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/31935] and (idaholab/moose#32239)[https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/32239]).

  - For example, `--append-runapp-cliarg="foo=bar"` will pass the command line option `foo=bar` to all tests that run a MOOSE application.

### UserObject and Postprocessor support in Kokkos-MOOSE

Kokkos-MOOSE now supports GPU-based [UserObjects](syntax/KokkosUserObjects/index.md) and [Postprocessors](syntax/KokkosUserObjects/index.md#reducers). Kokkos-MOOSE postprocessors leverage the reducer concept of Kokkos and have substantially different interface from the original MOOSE postprocessors. The Kokkos-MOOSE `VectorPostprocessors` and `Reporters` will also adopt the same reducer interface and be added soon. See the linked document for details.
