## MOOSE Improvements

### Capabilities Expansion

The use of the [Capabilities.md] system within the TestHarness has been expanded significantly in [idaholab/moose#32294](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/32294). Many test specification parameters that allow for the filtering or skipping of tests have been removed and must now use the `capabilities` test specification parameter. The use of these removed parameters will now produce an error with helpful information on what to specify as a capability instead.

For example, what was previously:

```
[Tests]
  [test]
    type = RunApp.i
    input = input.i
    min_ad_size = 50
    method = opt
    platform = linux
    vtk = true
  []
[]
```

Must now be described as:

```
[Tests]
  [test]
    type = RunApp.i
    input = input.i
    capabilities = 'ad_size>=50 & method=opt & platform=linux & vtk'
  []
[]
```

In the future, many more test specification parameters will be transitioned to use the `capabilities` parameter, such as: `min_parallel`, `max_parallel`, `min_threads`, `max_threads`, `heavy`, and `valgrind`.
