## Mailing List is Back!

We will utilize this mailing list as a platform for notifying users of announcements on the MOOSE GitHub Discussions page.

!include help/contact_us.md start=moose-announce end=moose-announce+ include-end=True

You can expect occasional messages about things like newsletters (once a month) and upcoming
trainings and conferences. This list will remain low traffic, with only a few messages a month, and
is not enabled for discussion. Announcements made there will link to the corresponding GitHub
Discussions post for further engagement and discussion.

## MOOSE Improvements

### Capabilities Expansion

The use of the [Capabilities.md] system within the TestHarness has been expanded significantly in [idaholab/moose#32294](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/32294). Many test specification parameters that allow for the filtering or skipping of tests have been removed and must now use the `capabilities` test specification parameter. The use of these removed parameters will now produce an error with helpful information on what to specify as a capability instead.

For example, what was previously:

```
[Tests]
  [test]
    type = RunApp.i
    input = input.i
    min_ad_size = 50
    method = opt
    platform = linux
    vtk = true
  []
[]
```

Must now be described as:

```
[Tests]
  [test]
    type = RunApp.i
    input = input.i
    capabilities = 'ad_size>=50 & method=opt & platform=linux & vtk'
  []
[]
```

In the future, many more test specification parameters will be transitioned to use the `capabilities` parameter, such as: `min_parallel`, `max_parallel`, `min_threads`, `max_threads`, `heavy`, and `valgrind`.

## MOOSE Bug Fixes

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2026.02.13_6232e98_0` Update

- Added `MeshBase::Preparation` class, and setter APIs, supporting more fine-grained alternatives to `MeshBase::is_prepared()`.  Mesh generation and modification code can now query whether a mesh is prepared in specific ways, and mark a mesh as unprepared in specific ways, allowing for much more efficient use of partially-prepared meshes in complex mesh generators and systems of mesh generators.
- MeshGeneration::build_square()` now supports `C0POLYGON` elements, building a hexagonal mesh on a rectangular domain, with triangles and quads at boundaries to fit.
- `GhostingFunctor` subclasses must now override `clone()` in non-deprecated builds.  This allows the library to preserve their functionality when cloning a mesh.
- Added more `NemesisIO` getters, similar to `ExodusII_IO` APIs, to enable MOOSE `SolutionUserObject` compatibility with distributed mesh+solution files
- System::project_solution and project_vector can now optionally take a predicated element iterator range, to project on a subset of a mesh.
- Added `libmesh_config.h` entries to query static library build settings
- Added `Elem::operator!=` to test (up to reordering) element equality
- Added `Elem::total_family_tree_by_side()` helper function
- `configure --with-hdf5-required` now attempts to detect HDF5 in existing paths if no specific HDF5 paths are specified.
- Added store_dirichlet_operators option for reduced_basis training
- Compatibility with newer OSX SDKs

  - Fixes for MetaPhysicL compatibility with more-standards-conforming Apple clang
  - Workarounds for libMesh::Xdr compatibility with less-standard Apple XDR

- Assorted bug fixes

  - Backported fix for valgrind compatibility to contrib ExodusII v8.11
  - Fixed regression in builds with PETSc but without Hypre
  - Fixed copying of `interior_parent` pointers in certain corner cases when e.g. stitching or cloning meshes.
  - Fixed copying of AMR `children_on_boundary` setting when copying `BoundaryInfo`
  - Fixed multiple cases of `remote_elem` neighbors not being made into non-remote `Elem *` links after a previously-remote element is received during repartitioning of refined meshes
  - Weakened overzealous assertion on distributed meshes with `interior_parent` pointers
  - Ensured that cached data remains up to date after various mesh and boundary data operations
  - Infinite-element builder code is now compatible with more general unstructured distributed meshes.
  - `InfQuad::is_child_on_side()` is no longer completely broken.
