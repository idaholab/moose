## Mailing List is Back!

We will utilize this mailing list as a platform for notifying users of announcements on the MOOSE GitHub Discussions page.

!include help/contact_us.md start=moose-announce end=moose-announce+ include-end=True

You can expect occasional messages about things like newsletters (once a month) and upcoming
trainings and conferences. This list will remain low traffic, with only a few messages a month, and
is not enabled for discussion. Announcements made there will link to the corresponding GitHub
Discussions post for further engagement and discussion.
