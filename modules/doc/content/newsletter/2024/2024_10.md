## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.10.17` Update

- Support for reading (the surface triangulations defined by) STL
  files.  This combined with our recent tetrahedralization support
  also allows for creating volume meshes from STL files; however,
  creating high-quality volume meshes from arbitrary STL files is
  still a work in progress.
- Support for higher-order (up to quintic) vector-valued FE bases in
  the Nédélec (first kind) and Ravier-Thomas FE families.
- Better handling for odd IsoGeometric Analysis extraction operators,
  and better error handling for broken IGA operators.
- Better unit test coverage for NodeElem; fixes to NodeElem
  methods which should be no-op but instead threw errors.
- Unit test coverage for fifth-order `MONOMIAL` elements.  So far
  new tests have not uncovered any problems, but based on user
  reports of convergence issues we recommend limiting `MONOMIAL`
  variables to fourth-order.
- Fixes for condensed eigensolve support after mesh reinit
- Fixes for caching of FE data on sides of meshes with non-uniform
  p-refinement levels
- Minor fixes for compiler complaints from `nvc++` and
  `clang++ -fsanitize`
- Properly register `--keep-cout` and `--drop-cerr` warnings with
  PETSc to avoid "options you set that were not used" false positives.
- Better error messages when tetrahedralizing a non-watertight input
  boundary mesh.
- Refactoring in AbaqusIO, to enable subclasses in MOOSE code with
  experimental support for more advanced file features.
- Improvements and fixes in Reduced Basis code, particularly the
  Empirical Interpolation Method classes.


## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

## Conda Package Changes

- `moose-mpi`, our lowest level package, has been updated to allow users wishing to
  build their own PETSc, libMesh, WASP to do so without needing to install any
  additional Conda packages.
- HDF5 has been downgraded to solve issue: [Floating Point Exception, #28350](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/28350)
- The minimum MacOS build SDK has been bumped to MacOS Big Sur (11.3). Users of
  MacOS versions older than this may run into issues building and running MOOSE, 
  MOOSE dependencies, or other   MOOSE-based applications.
