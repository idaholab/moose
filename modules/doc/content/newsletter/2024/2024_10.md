## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

## Conda Package Changes

- `moose-mpi`, our lowest level package, has been updated to allow users wishing to
  build their own PETSc, libMesh, WASP to do so without needing to install any
  additional Conda packages.
- HDF5 has been downgraded to solve issue: [Floating Point Exception, #28350](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/28350)
- The minimum MacOS build SDK has been bumped to MacOS Big Sur (11.3). Users of
  MacOS versions older than this may run into issues building and running MOOSE, 
  MOOSE dependencies, or other   MOOSE-based applications.
