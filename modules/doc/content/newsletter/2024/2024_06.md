## MOOSE Improvements

### Using Physics on Components

A new component, [FileMeshPhysicsComponent.md], was created in the thermal hydraulics module to leverage the [Physics](Physics/index.md) system. This facilitates the use of multi-dimensional equations in a thermal hydraulics simulation including, notably, the finite volume computational fluid dynamics capabilities of the Navier Stokes module.

### Facilitating the use of mixture models

The [WCNSFVTwoPhaseMixturePhysics.md] was added to the Navier Stokes module. This facilitates the setup of fully coupled finite volume simulations using a simple two phase mixture model. It can be used for both solidification and liquid mixture problems.

### Mesh generator to perform mesh rotational extrusion

The [RevolveGenerator.md] was added to create a revolution, or rotational extrusion, of a 2D mesh into 3D.
This could be a new approach for defining control drum meshes in microreactors, for using 2D meshes to create 3D problems,
or for very basic meshing of fusion tokamak devices.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- Support for finite volume variables was added to [ProjectionAux.md]
- Support for specifying functors in parsed expressions was added to [ParsedAux.md]
- Subdomain names can now be pre-declared in the `[Mesh]` block, for subdomains that will be created during the simulation but do not exist at initialization. Objects can be block-restricted to these blocks at initialization.
- Sideset IDs and names can now be pre-declared in the `[Mesh]` block, for sidesets that will be created during the simulation but do not exist at initialization. Objects can be boundaries-restricted to these boundaries at initialization.
- The [CombinerGenerator.md] now has the option to avoid merging subdomains and sidesets with the same IDs in the meshes that it combines. When these options are selected, the IDs are offset based on the maximum ID used in the meshes being combined.
