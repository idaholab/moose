## MOOSE Improvements

### Added convection functor material

The [functor material](/FunctorMaterials/index.md)
[(AD)ConvectionHeatFluxFunctorMaterial](/functormaterials/ConvectionHeatFluxFunctorMaterial.md)
was added, which computes the convection heat flux from a solid surface to a fluid,
taking the heat transfer coefficient, solid temperature, and fluid temperature
as [functor](/Functors/index.md) parameters.

### WebServerControl

A new [/Controls/index.md] object, the [/WebServerControl.md], was added to the framework that allows
for external control of a MOOSE-based simulation. It works by starting a web-server that exposes a
[REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) that any external application or
script can access in order to control the execution of MOOSE. The current capabilities are intended
to be used by external "controllers" - typically those built using AI/ML in Python/Matlab/etc.

The web server is controlled by an accompanying Python utility, the [MooseControl/index.md].

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.04.23` Update

- Improved TriangulatorInterface compatibility with quadratic elements
  in boundary and hole meshes, including adjusting triangulation
  elements to match curved boundaries.  This feature is not yet
  compatible with mid-triangulation boundary refinement.
- Added scaling options to Empirical Interpolation Method in
  Reduced-Basis code, handling for cases with linearly dependent
  data, and update plotting.
- Fixed bugs in visualization output of Lagrange data on Tri7, in
  `DirichletBoundary` application on nodesets generated from sidesets,
  and in FEMContext quadrature selection for cases where the first
  variable of a system is higher-order than any of the variables being
  queried by the context.  This last fix prevents excessive numbers of
  quadrature points from being used in some MOOSE GeneralField
  transfer operations.
