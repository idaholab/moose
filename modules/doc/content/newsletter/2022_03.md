for a complete description of all MOOSE changes.

## MPICH Updated to 4.0.1, GCC to 10.3.0

The `moose-mpich` package has been updated to 4.0.1 and now relies entirely on
the MPICH built by the conda-forge maintainers (`mpich-mpicc`, `mpich-mpicxx`,
and `mpich-mpifort`). As a result of this change, the default compilers installed
on Linux using the MOOSE package are now GCC 10.3.0 / gfortran 10.3.0. Minimum
supported compilers (see [below](2022_03.md#cxx17-support)) remain the same and
Clang 12.0.1 / gfortran 9.3.0 is still the default compiler set on MacOS. The bulk
of MOOSE PR testing will still be done using GCC 9, to maintain compatibility over
a broad range of compiler releases.

To update your MOOSE packages, please activate your MOOSE conda environment and
perform the command:

```
conda update --all
```

The following package versions and builds outlined in the update prompt should be
at least the following:

```
Package                  Version            Build
=====================================================
moose-libmesh            2022.03.18         build_0
moose-libmesh-vtk        9.1.0              build_5
moose-petsc              3.16.5             build_0
moose-mpich              4.0.1              build_0
```

## MOOSE Improvements

### C++17 Support id=cxx17-support

MOOSE now requires a C++17 capable compiler and supports C++17 features. With
this, GCC 7 and Clang 5 are now the minimum supported compilers.

### HDF5 support in PETSc and libMesh now requested by default

The `update_and_rebuild_petsc` script now performs a basic search for a supported
HDF5 installation in the local environment by default. Developers can place an
HDF5 installation in the following searched locations:

- `/usr/lib/hdf5`
- `/usr/local/hdf5`
- `/usr/share/hdf5`
- `/usr/local/hdf5/share`
- `$HOME/.local`

Or select a custom location by setting one of the environment variables `HDF5_DIR`,
`HDF5DIR`, or `HDF5_ROOT`. If a compatible installation cannot be found, PETSc
will download and build it for the user on Linux. This fallback download option
is not yet available on MacOS, but will be coming soon. Subsequently, the
`update_and_rebuild_libmesh` script now uses the `--enable-hdf5` configure flag
and, with recent libMesh changes, attempts to find the HDF5 installation used by
PETSc.

The new conda packages mentioned above all contain the PETSc default HDF5 on Linux,
but no HDF5 is currently provided on MacOS (coming soon). A serial, pre-built HDF5
is available within the `moose-tools` package on either platform if this is sufficient
for developer needs.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2022.03.18` Update

- Update MetaPhysicL

  - `OpFunction` support for `DualNumber` and `SemiDynamicSparseNumberArray`, which
    means we can now do basic parallel `sum()` etc. on AD values.

- `get_nodeset_info()` to get nodeset info
- Fixes up deprecation warnings in custom iterators due to C++17
- `Poly2Tri` updates/bugfixes related to refinement
- Support for non-uniform refinement with `Poly2Tri`
- Added virtual methods for specifying index maps that we can use for defining
  the `RBParameterizedFunction` used in EIM approximations
- Update MetaPhysicL

  - Add ValueType for `std::array`, `std::vector`
  - Implement `ReplaceAlgebraicType`
  - Add tolerance to `DynamicSparseNumberBase::sparsity_trim`
  - Simplify end/begin/rend/rbegin
  - When we exceed our `DynamicStdArray` wrapper container size, we'll throw

- Make `DynamicStdArrayWrapper` member protected
- Factor out push_node, respect offset
- Allow proper constness for our MeshBase iterators
- `libmesh_not_implemented()` in all unimplemented `TypeNTensor` functions
- README: branching description, devel Civet badge
- memcpy warning fix in `TypeNTensor`
- `Poly2Tri` refinement fixes

### `2022.03.02` Update

- Work towards source code compatibility with Windows
- Add an additional `outer_product` definition that supports `scalar * vector -> vector`
- Add auto-detection for PETSc external packages, notably HDF5
- Add internal thread safety within `NumericVector` subclasses
- Add initial support for `Poly2Tri` triangulations and refactor `TriangulatorInterface`
- Optimize `InfFE::reinit` when not all data has been requested
- Support the matrix-free case when computing the residual and Jacobian together
- Add more robust `Packing` for communication of fixed-size classes win variable-size containers
- Enable setting PETSc mat/vec types at runtime for future GPU use
- Require C++17 support and begin using it internally
- Add new static `TensorValue::rotation_matrix` helper functions

## PETSc-level Changes

PETSc has been updated to the 3.16.5 release. This release should have performance
improvements and better infrastructure support, but much of the update is transparent
to MOOSE users. The detailed PETSc release notes can be found at [the PETSc website](https://petsc.org/release/docs/changes/316/).

Changes that may be interesting to MOOSE users include the following:

- Added PCQR - an interface to SuiteSparse QR factorization, which is a direct
  solver. This can be triggered in MOOSE using the `-pc_type qr` option.
- PETSc has better GPU support via native solver options like GAMG, or other third-party
  solver options such as HYPRE. The enhanced GPU capability can be triggered in
  MOOSE via the `-mat_type aijcusparse -vec_type cuda` command line option. Note
  that GPU capability is still experimental in MOOSE, and only algebra solver
  operations are available on GPUs. Residual and Jacobian evaluations are not
  available on GPUs yet. If you want to have meaningful performance improvement,
  you have to explore many problem-dependent PETSc options.
