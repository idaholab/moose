## MOOSE Improvements

### Field splits of statically condensed systems

MOOSE can now perform field split preconditioning of statically condensed systems. This required
generalization of the degree of freedom map in libMesh as well as the MOOSE PETSc Data Management
(DM) code in MOOSE. The current target application for this development is preconditioning of
statically condensed hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) Navier-Stokes discretizations, which we
discussed in the [June newsletter](2025_06.md).

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.08.05` Update

- Added support for vector-valued variables in `MeshFunction`, with
  regression testing for `LAGRANGE_VEC`, `NEDELEC_ONE`, and
  `RAVIART_THOMAS` cases.
- Added support for `std::set` values in `Parameters`
- Added generation of boundary condition ids in `NetGenMeshInterface`
  output
- Added support for sliding boundary nodes and higher-order elements
  to `VariationalMeshSmoother`
- Added `SmoothnessEstimator`, switched `HPCoarsenTest` to enable
  smoothness-aware hp adaptivity selection
- Fixed undefined behavior in `ExodusII_IO` input support for Bezier
  Extraction blocks
- Fixed support for `configure --enable-glibcxx-debugging`
- Added `contains()` and `ends_with()` utilities; used these to fix
  broken read support for files with base names of 4 characters or
  fewer.
- Changed `GhostingFunctor` containers to use `vector` rather than
  `set`, to avoid undefined behavior in functors that do parallel
  communication.  Any application code that hard coded the previous
  container iterator return type may need to change to use `auto` or
  the new iterator `typedef`.
- Refactored `add_periodic_boundary`, added more error checking
- Optimizations in `VariationalMeshSmoother`
- Early-return optimization in `RBEimConstruction`
- Corrected link to DataTransferKit repository in
  `DTKSolutionTransfer` documentation
- Corrected `configure --help` output to reflect default-enabled
  status of Poly2Tri, Netgen, and Qhull
- Fix indentation in tests/Makefile.am
- Make sure dof index containers sized even when not active on block

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes, Minor Changes, and Minor Enhancements

-  Added a new Times object `ControllableInputTimes` which specify a time sequence dynamically updating during the simulation
-  Fixed bug in `TimeSequenceStepper` that caused segfault when restarting

## Conda Package Changes
