## MOOSE Improvements

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.08.05` Update

- Added support for vector-valued variables in `MeshFunction`, with
  regression testing for `LAGRANGE_VEC`, `NEDELEC_ONE`, and
  `RAVIART_THOMAS` cases.
- Added support for `std::set` values in `Parameters`
- Added generation of boundary condition ids in `NetGenMeshInterface`
  output
- Added support for sliding boundary nodes and higher-order elements
  to `VariationalMeshSmoother`
- Added `SmoothnessEstimator`, switched `HPCoarsenTest` to enable
  smoothness-aware hp adaptivity selection
- Fixed undefined behavior in `ExodusII_IO` input support for Bezier
  Extraction blocks
- Fixed support for `configure --enable-glibcxx-debugging`
- Added `contains()` and `ends_with()` utilities; used these to fix
  broken read support for files with base names of 4 characters or
  fewer.
- Changed `GhostingFunctor` containers to use `vector` rather than
  `set`, to avoid undefined behavior in functors that do parallel
  communication.  Any application code that hard coded the previous
  container iterator return type may need to change to use `auto` or
  the new iterator `typedef`.
- Refactored `add_periodic_boundary`, added more error checking
- Optimizations in `VariationalMeshSmoother`
- Early-return optimization in `RBEimConstruction`
- Corrected link to DataTransferKit repository in
  `DTKSolutionTransfer` documentation
- Corrected `configure --help` output to reflect default-enabled
  status of Poly2Tri, Netgen, and Qhull
- Fix indentation in tests/Makefile.am
- Make sure dof index containers sized even when not active on block
