## MOOSE Improvements

### Preliminary Kokkos-MOOSE release

A new GPU backend, [Kokkos](https://kokkos.org/), was added in MOOSE and is available for preliminary testing with NVIDIA GPUs. Kokkos-MOOSE provides programming and user interfaces that are designed to resemble the original MOOSE interfaces to make adaptation easier and reduce porting efforts. Kokkos-MOOSE currently supports the GPU version of [Kernels](syntax/KokkosKernels/index.md), [NodalKernels](syntax/KokkosNodalKernels/index.md), [BCs](syntax/KokkosBCs/index.md), and [Materials](syntax/KokkosMaterials/index.md) and will be continuously extended to incorporate more MOOSE capabilities and support more GPU vendors. See [this page](getting_started/installation/install_kokkos.md) to get started with Kokkos-MOOSE.

### TestHarness `--only-tests-that-require` option

The `capability` parameter for test specifications allows for run-time checking of if a test can or cannot run based on capabilities defined by the application executable. The `--only-tests-that-require` command line option has been added to the [TestHarness.md], which allows filtering of tests based on whether or not they depend on a capability.

For example, take a situation in which `./run_tests --only-tests-that-require cuda` is ran along with the following test specification:

```
[Tests]
  [needs_cuda]
    ...
    capabilities = 'cuda'
  []
  [doesnt_need_cuda]
    ...
    capabilities = 'libtorch'
  []
[]
```

In this case, the test `needs_cuda` will be ran beacuse it depends on the `cuda` capability, while the `doesnt_need_cuda` test will not run because it does not depend on the `cuda` capability.
