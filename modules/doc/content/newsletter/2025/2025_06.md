### `2025.06.26` Update

- Complete overhaul of `VariationalMeshSmoother` code.  This gives
  support for more finite element types and converges to more optimal
  meshes.
- Enabled FE caching as appropriate for variable types with a
  dependency on edge/face orientation.  Added command-line
  `--disable-caching` option to help with debugging.
- Refactoring of `StaticCondensation` code, improved support for
  static condensation with adaptive mesh refinement.
- Added `matrixsolve` app for testing linear solver behavior with mesh
  files
- Avoid redundant work when preparing algebraic ghosting in parallel
- Compatibility with more Abaqus-format mesh files
- Support for `Elem::opposite_side()` on `Prism` elements
- Fixes for `BoundaryInfo::sync()` with certain combinations of serial
  and distributed mesh status.  Enabled serialization and/or
  redistribution of distributed boundary meshes with separate interior
  meshes.  Added `MeshBase::interior_mesh()` to track the interior
  mesh of a boundary mesh.
- Fix unintentionally set `parent()` on 0D side elements of 1D
  interior elements.  Removed deprecated `proxy` option from side and
  edge element construction.
- Refactoring to use new `Elem::inherit_data_from()` helper.  This
  likely fixes potential issues on certain IGA and p-refined meshes.
- More exhaustive testing for `BoundaryInfo::sync()` methods,
  including multiple combinations of mesh type, distribution status,
  and dimensionality.
- Clarifications in Doxygen documentation
- Minor code simplification/refactoring
- Update TIMPI submodule

  - Enabled `minloc()` and `maxloc()` of arbitrary data types
    overriding `TIMPI::OpFunction<T>`.  Added tests using
    `OpFunction<std::pair>`.
  - Added missing cstdint include, fixing builds with some compilers.
