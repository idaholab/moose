## MOOSE Improvements

### New user-oriented tutorial featuring the National Reactor Innovation Center DOME Test Bed

A [user-oriented tutorial](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/user_workshop/index.html#/1) was released on the MOOSE website.
It features a simplified nuclear engineering study of the DOME shield, used in the National Reactor Innovation Center
to test micro-reactors. It does not involve or teach coding new objects, only using techniques in MOOSE tools to create simulations
with existing, pre-developed, capabilities.

It can be taught using the pre-compiled MOOSE combined binaries, reducing setup time to a minimum.

### New Positions objects

The [NodePositions.md] was added to gather the positions of nodes in either the mesh or subdomains of the mesh into a
[Positions.md] object. Note that these objects can then be used to create [MultiApps](MultiApps/index.md) or set up reduction
operations, [MeshDivisions](MeshDivisions/index.md) and so on.

The [ParsedDownSelectionPositions.md] was added to downselect positions from another `Positions` object using a parsed expression
and/or combinations of criteria. We expect this provides sufficient flexibility to avoid having to code new `Positions` objects
for most applications.

### Physics and ActionComponents workflow

A helper class was created for placing and rotating [ActionComponents](syntax/ActionComponents/index.md), the `ComponentMeshTransformHelper`.

[Physics](syntax/Physics/index.md) can now use dedicated APIs to skip the creation of a variable, an initial condition or a time derivative
when another `Physics` or other user syntax has already created them. This simplifies combining `Physics`.

To further improve compatibility between `Physics` and legacy or new syntax, tasks such as 'adding kernels' or 'adding boundary conditions'
can now be skipped using the `dont_create_<xyz>` parameters shared by all `PhysicsBase`-derived classes. This partial setup can then
be replaced by the other syntax.

### Field Transfers changes

The `search_value_conflicts` is now turned off by default for `MultiAppGeneralFieldTransfer`-derived classes. This diagnostic was scaling
as the square of the size of the simulation and should only be used for debugging. Turning it off by default is more in line with current
development practices.
The `error_on_miss` diagnostic is now turned on by default for `MultiAppGeneralFieldTransfer`-derived classes. This diagnostic comes at
no-cost and prevents missing values for target regions that are not mapped properly to source regions. The solution to these errors is usually to increase the size of the source region bounding boxes.

`UserObjects`, including postprocessors and vector-postprocessors, can now be executed in the parent application right before the `transfers`,
on the `TRANSFER` execution flag. This permits the provision of the most up-to-date values by these user objects. In the child applications,
the `TIMESTEP_END` default execution flag should suffice to obtain updated values to be transferred.

## MOOSE Modules Changes

### Navier Stokes module

A two phase mixture model using the drift flux approximation was added in the linear finite volume discretization of the Navier Stokes
equations. This model is accessible using the [WCNSLinearFVTwoPhaseMixturePhysics.md].

!alert note title=Known limitations
Please note that buoyancy terms are not currently reconstructed, hence accuracy may be limited in buoyant regimes near boundaries.
Additionally, non-orthogonal meshes should not be used with the linear finite volume implementation of the mixture model at this time.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.06.26` Update

- Complete overhaul of `VariationalMeshSmoother` code.  This gives
  support for more finite element types and converges to more optimal
  meshes.
- Enabled FE caching as appropriate for variable types with a
  dependency on edge/face orientation.  Added command-line
  `--disable-caching` option to help with debugging.
- Refactoring of `StaticCondensation` code, improved support for
  static condensation with adaptive mesh refinement.
- Added `matrixsolve` app for testing linear solver behavior with mesh
  files
- Avoid redundant work when preparing algebraic ghosting in parallel
- Compatibility with more Abaqus-format mesh files
- Support for `Elem::opposite_side()` on `Prism` elements
- Fixes for `BoundaryInfo::sync()` with certain combinations of serial
  and distributed mesh status.  Enabled serialization and/or
  redistribution of distributed boundary meshes with separate interior
  meshes.  Added `MeshBase::interior_mesh()` to track the interior
  mesh of a boundary mesh.
- Fix unintentionally set `parent()` on 0D side elements of 1D
  interior elements.  Removed deprecated `proxy` option from side and
  edge element construction.
- Refactoring to use new `Elem::inherit_data_from()` helper.  This
  likely fixes potential issues on certain IGA and p-refined meshes.
- More exhaustive testing for `BoundaryInfo::sync()` methods,
  including multiple combinations of mesh type, distribution status,
  and dimensionality.
- Clarifications in Doxygen documentation
- Minor code simplification/refactoring
- Update TIMPI submodule

  - Enabled `minloc()` and `maxloc()` of arbitrary data types
    overriding `TIMPI::OpFunction<T>`.  Added tests using
    `OpFunction<std::pair>`.
  - Added missing cstdint include, fixing builds with some compilers.


## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes, Minor Changes, and Minor Enhancements

- The [PatternedCartesianGenerator.md] can now accept a user-parameter for the boundary to use for stitching meshed elements of the pattern.
- The [Convergence system](syntax/Convergence/index.md) can now be used with linear systems, used with `solve_type = LINEAR` in the `Executioner`.
- The `OversampleOutput` class, used to refine meshes before useing them for output, has been renamed to `SampledOutput` and now supports the block
  restriction of the simulation mesh for sampling purposes. This enables block-restricted `Exodus` output.
