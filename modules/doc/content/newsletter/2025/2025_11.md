## MOOSE Improvements

### Mesh generation

The [PolyLineMeshFollowingNodeSetGenerator.md] has been added to generate a 1D line mesh, of `edge` elements, by averaging
the positions of nodes in a multi-dimensional nodeset. Several options and heuristics have been implemented to further define the averaging process.

### DiscreteVariableResidualNorm now uses the un-scaled residual norm

[DiscreteVariableResidualNorm.md] has added the parameter [!param](/Postprocessors/DiscreteVariableResidualNorm/include_scaling_factor), which allows the user to control whether the residual norm includes the scaling factor or not. Before, the scaling factor was always included, but now the default behavior is to not include the scaling factor. This is ideal for the most common use case of this object, which is convergence monitoring, which usually should be independent of the scaling factor.

## MOOSE Modules Changes

### Navier Stokes module

The Physics syntax for the weakly compressible Navier Stokes equations can now accept a `fp` parameter for the fluid properties
being used. This helps define the functor materials needed to compute fluid properties in the kernels forming the equations.

## Bug Fixes, Minor Changes, and Minor Enhancements

- Several controls that were unable to recover properly when set to execute on `TIMESTEP_END` have been fixed.
- The `simulation_time_interval` output parameter, which was not functioning, has been removed. The `min_simulation_time_interval`
  should be used instead.
- The distributed rectilinear mesh generator now only offers `edge`, `quad`, and `hex` element types, which
  were the only element types supported. Other element types can still be generated by conversion.
- The [SolutionUserObject.md] now caches retrieval calls at a given location, to prevent scaling with the square
  of the number of variables.
