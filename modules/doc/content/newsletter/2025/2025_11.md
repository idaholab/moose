## MOOSE Improvements

### Mesh generation

The [PolyLineMeshFollowingNodeSetGenerator.md] has been added to generate a 1D line mesh, of `edge` elements, by averaging
the positions of nodes in a multi-dimensional nodeset. Several options and heuristics have been implemented to further define the averaging process.

The [XYZDelaunayGenerator.md] now has an option to only convert the boundary of a `hole` mesh to tetrahedrals, rather than the entire `hole` mesh.
A `hole` mesh is a mesh that is pre-existing and forming a hole inside the Delaunay tetrahedralization (and thus does not need to be tetrahedralized).

### Array variable support for nodal kernels

Array nodal kernels, forming residual and Jacobian contributions for array variables, can now be created in MOOSE.

### KokkosFunction

The [KokkosFunction](syntax/KokkosFunctions/index.md) system was added to deliver the same capability as `Functions` but in Kokkos-based
finite element simulations. As a reminder, `Functions` are intended to be known functions of time and space exclusively, and not depend
on material properties or variable values.

### DiscreteVariableResidualNorm now uses the un-scaled residual norm

[DiscreteVariableResidualNorm.md] has added the parameter [!param](/Postprocessors/DiscreteVariableResidualNorm/include_scaling_factor), which allows the user to control whether the residual norm includes the scaling factor or not. Before, the scaling factor was always included, but now the default behavior is to not include the scaling factor. This is ideal for the most common use case of this object, which is convergence monitoring, which usually should be independent of the scaling factor.

## MOOSE Modules Changes

### Navier Stokes module

The Physics syntax for the weakly compressible Navier Stokes equations can now accept a `fp` parameter for the fluid properties
being used. This helps define the functor materials needed to compute fluid properties in the kernels forming the equations.

### Porous flow module

Two new `ActionComponents` were created to add injection and production wells in a compact syntax.
These wells are represented by multiple objects to represent the flow channel from the well, and the boundary condition
at the well.

### Heat transfer module

The P1 radiation model was added with the linear finite volume discretization. The use of this discretization facilitates
coupling convective flow problems, solved notably in the Navier Stokes module using this discretization, directly alongside
radiative heat transfer.

### Subchannel module

A new [SCMClosure system](syntax/SCMClosures/index.md) was added to allow for user-developers to specify the closures to use
in the subchannel solve. For now, only the friction factors can be selected in this system. Developers may create new closures
in this system, with a dedicated base class for each physical quantity computed using a closure.

Additional options were added for the computation of the heat transfer coefficient for the fuel pin and duct temperatures:

- the Dittus Boelter correlation (previously only option)
- the Kazimi-Carelli correlation
- the Gielinski correlation

### Reactor module

The [PinMeshGenerator.md] now supports the generation of a [CSGBase.md]. `CSG` objects are intended to provide a compatible path
from reactor-module meshes to CSG used in Monte Carlo codes.

## Bug Fixes, Minor Changes, and Minor Enhancements

- Several controls that were unable to recover properly when set to execute on `TIMESTEP_END` have been fixed.
- The `simulation_time_interval` output parameter, which was not functioning, has been removed. The `min_simulation_time_interval`
  should be used instead.
- The distributed rectilinear mesh generator now only offers `edge`, `quad`, and `hex` element types, which
  were the only element types supported. Other element types can still be generated by conversion.
- The [SolutionUserObject.md] now caches retrieval calls at a given location, to prevent scaling with the square
  of the number of variables.
- The `Makefile` system in MOOSE now allows for linking additional objects directly to the executable using the `ADDITIONAL_EXEC_OBJECTS`
  variable.
- PETSc SNES options are no longer added by default when using the linear finite volume discretization, which does not use the nonlinear
  SNES solver.
- Material property output for array material properties can now support arrays of more than 10 components.
- The [BDF2.md] time integrator was expanded to support linear finite volume equations.
