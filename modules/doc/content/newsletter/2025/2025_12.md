## MOOSE Improvements

### MFEM Backend improvements

- Changed time-dependent equation system class, [TimeDependentEquationSystem.md], and the respective operator class,
  `TimeDependentEquationSystemProblemOperator`, to set up problems described in terms of the state of the system at the
  next timestep, instead of time derivatives
- Fixed a bug whereby contributions for some integrated BCs were being incorrectly accounted for in transient problems
- Added [MFEMMUMPS.md] to provide an alternative to [MFEMSuperLU.md] for direct solves using LU decomposition
- Removed a workaround in [MFEMScalarFESpace.md] and [MFEMVectorFESpace.md] for an MFEM bug related to the naming of
  finite element collections constructed with the default choice of basis

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.11.25_c144a6e` Update

- A long-deprecated behavior has been removed: code initializing data
  using an `FE` object now *must* prerequest all data it will later
  access; it can no longer prerequest nothing and rely on libMesh to
  interpret that as a potential need for everything.
- A large number of long-deprecated APIs have been removed:
  - The `DofObject::set_unique_id()` overload that returns a reference
    is gone; use the overload that takes an argument instead.
  - `Elem::centroid()` is gone.  Code that requires an accurate
    approximation of ths should be using `Elem::true_centroid()`
    instead; code that requires a non-centroidal but
    quick-to-calculate internal point should be using
    `Elem::vertex_average()` instead.
  - `Elem::which_node_am_i()` is gone.  Use `Elem::local_side_node()`
    instead.
  - The `BoundaryInfo::build_*_list()` overloads that fill vector
    arguments are gone.  Use the overloads that return vectors
    instead, or use the `multimap` getters.
  - `CondensedEigenSystem` no longer supports direct access to raw
    `condensed_matrix_A` and `condensed_matrix_B` pointers; use e.g.
    `get_condensed_matrix_A()` instead.
  - The `MeshFunction::init()` overload taking a tree build type is
    gone.  Use the other `init()` overload instead.
  - The poorly named `EquationSystems::get_solution()` is gone.  Use
    `EquationSystems::build_elemental_solution_vector() for elemental
    data instead.
  - `System::read_legacy_data()` is gone.  Use libMesh .xda files that
    postdate 2007, and show your pre-2007 libMesh .xda files to Roy to
    amuse and delight him.
  - The old `libmesh/mesh_inserter_iterator.h` header is gone.  Rely
    on `Node` and `Elem` unpacking specializations to insert
    communicated objects into a target `UnstructuredMesh`.
  - The `libmesh_make_unique` macro is gone.  Use `std::make_unique`
    directly.
  - The old `libmesh/auto_ptr.h` header and macro is gone.  Use
    `std::unique_ptr`.
  - `Utility::iota()` and `Utility::is_sorted()` are gone.  Use
    `std::iota()` and `std::is_sorted()`
  - `DynaIO::clear_spline_nodes()` is gone.  Use
    `MeshTools::clear_spline_nodes()` instead.
  - `DifferentiableSystem::swap_physics()` is gone.  Use `push_physics()` and
    `pop_physics()` instead.
  - `DifferentiableSystem::init_qoi()` is gone.  Override
    `DifferentiableQoI::init_qoi_count()` in `DifferentiableQoI`
    subclasses instead.
  - `RBParameterized::get_parameter_names()` and an
    `RBEvaluation::eval_output_dual_norm()` overload have been
    removed.  Use `get_parameters_map()` or the remaining
    `eval_output_dual_norm()` overload.
  - Drop deprecated `MeshBase::insert_node()` API. Use `add_node()` instead
  - Drop deprecated `Parallel::Utils::is_sorted()`. Use `std::is_sorted()` instead
  - Drop deprecated qoi code. Unlikely to affect MOOSE user code
  - Drop deprecated InfFE code. Unlikely to affect MOOSE user code
  - Drop deprecated MeshRefinement accessor APIs. Use
    `MeshRefinement::enforce_mismatch_limit_prior_to_refinement()`
- libMesh now throws `DegenerateMap` exceptions when encountering
  singularities while evaluating geometric element mappings or
  factoring dense matrices, not `LogicError` exceptions, which are
  reserved for errors in logic.  Code catching these exceptions should
  use the new type, or for compatibility with old libMesh can catch
  `std::exception & e` and examine `e.what()` to determine the exception
  details.
- MetaPhysicL code can now run on accelerator/GPU devices, using Kokkos
- `VariationalSmoother` now supports meshes with tetrahedral elements.
- `VariationalSmoother` now supports fine-grained user-controlled
  verbosity, and emits better error messages in cases where a smoother
  optimization solve fails.
- Added `SparseMatrix::print_coreform_hdf5`, to create CSR-structured
  matrix data in HDF5 files in the Coreform format.
- `LaplaceMeshSmoother` now has API signatures to match
  `VariationalSmoother`.
- `Elem::size_vertex_average_normal()` now supports `Edge3` (and in
  theory `Edge4`) elements
- Added `ExodusII_IO::set_unique_ids_from_maps()` to set `unique_id()`
  rather than `id()` from Exodus file numbering.  This can be useful
  for efficiency when loading very sparse numberings into a
  `ReplicatedMesh`.
- Added `libmesh_assert_valid_point_locator()` method to verify
  `PointLocator` consistency when debugging with potentially-changed
  meshes
- Update citations
- Add mesh flag allowing Node/Elem unique_id overlap
- Remove bad pointer math fixing vertex average side normal for tet4
- Update TypeVector math for MetaPhysicL 2.0
- Make `solve_for_unconstrained_dofs()` public
- Warn when user attempts to use absolute step tolerance with PETSc
- Bug fixes:
  - The VariationalSmoother is now calculating target elements
    properly; this gives better-smoothed results for meshes with
    triangle, prism, and pyramid elements.
  - libMesh no longer triggers deprecation warnings with PETSc 3.24
    and newer versions
  - libMesh no longer triggers compiler warnings from NVidia HPC SDK
    compilers
  - Add ExodusII::set_max_name_length() to reduce truncation of long
    identifier strings in ExodusII files
  - Fix compatibility with AddressSanitizer flags
  - Fix mesh stitching with NodeElem surface
  - In exodus reader, if mesh is renumbered, don't load wrong solution vector data
