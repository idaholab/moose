## MOOSE Improvements

### `capabilities` parameter in `tests` specs

The MOOSE test harness provides numerous parameters to skip tests depending on capabilities
provided by the current executable. We have checks for the `petsc_version`, `required_submodules`,
the configured `ad_size` etc. Those checks all require custom python functions that parse
configuration files and probe the source tree.

The new [`capabilities` parameter](Capabilities.md) combines all the test harness parameters that probe
built-in functionality of the executable, and provides a flecible boolean expression parser to construct
abitrary conditions that test execution depends on. Capabilities now relies on an application
internal registry that can be queried with the `--show-capabilities` option. For example

```
    min_ad_size = 150
    method = '!dbg'
```

is now

```
    capabilities = 'ad_size>=150 & method!=dbg'
```

Application and module developers can register their own capabilities using the `addCapability` function.
Check `MooseApp::registerCapabilities()` for examples.

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.04.02` Update

- Set nullspace for both J and P operators because PETSc may look at either when setting up linear solves
- No longer need to manually set hypre memory location for PETSc 3.23. This was previously required for MOOSE stack builds with GPU enabled because PETSc's hook into hypre assumed that any configuration enabling GPU support should always run with data structures on device
- Just use `DIFFERENT_NONZERO_PATTERN` in `MatCopy` in `PetscMatrix::operator=`. This is much more robust than using `SAME_NONZERO_PATTERN`
- Assert `verify` calls where appropriate
- Change API name `SparseMatrix::reset_memory` to `SparseMatrix::restore_original_nonzero_pattern`. The new API name better reflects both the focus of the API and also that this API may not perform any memory allocation/deallocation as long as previous fills of the matrix have matched the original preallocation
- Better error message from `System::read_serialized_vectors()` when encountering a difference between the number of vectors we expect to read vs. the number of vectors declared in the XDR header
- Lock at `PetscMatrix` level when doing add/set. This will allow user code to remove their mutex locks around matrix assembly and also saves users who did not previously have proper mutex locking in threaded regions of their code
- Add mutex to fparser `setEpsilon` to prevent thread races
- Add `QBase::get_base_order()` API allowing comparison of multiple quadrature rules independent of p-refinement level
- Update TIMPI submodule
    - Use MPI-4 APIs for `MPI_Count`, i.e. 64-bit, size support, when available
    - Fix for uninitialized warning with gcc 13.3
- Remove phony make code which could trigger multiple netgen builds
- Get metaphysicl config include
- Allow instantiation of `DenseVector::print` with dual numbers
- CheckpointIO can now handle some of the Mesh caches if needed. MOOSE often skips partitioning when doing checkpoint restart, so now at the libMesh level we `recalculate_n_partitions()` and `update_post_partitioning()` when that is the case.
- Add begin/end members to DenseVector allowing for range based looping
- Avoid creating temporary array for hashword2() overload taking 64-bit inputs

### `2025.04.17` Update

- Autoconf-submodule (ACSM) update
  - When recent clang versions are detected, the compiler flag
    `-fno-assume-unique-vtables` is used.  This enables `dynamic_cast`
    to work reliably on macOS 15 (Sequoia) environments, which fixes a
    number of libMesh and MOOSE failures there.
  - More thorough detection for code coverage support when
    --enable-coverage builds may require it from multiple languages'
    compilers.
- TIMPI submodule update
  - Fixes and tests for `timpi_version.h` utilities
  - Unit test fixes for C++14 compilers
  - `timpi_pure` attribute for pure functions; on C++17 and newer
    compilers this prevents ignoring the function return values
  - Marked `verify()` and `semiverify()` as pure.  This prevents the
    common usage error of not asserting the result when intended.
  - Removed default `Attributes` values.  Code which attempts
    parallel reductions on user-defined types without first specifying
    their attributes now fails to compile, instead of compiling but not
    working correctly.
- Added support for creating and computing on arbitrary polygons in 2D
- Better tolerance computations when stitching meshes along a boundary
  with discrete NodeElem elements
- Fix for reading of Gmsh files with physicals of different types but
  the same id numbers
- Migrated more print methods of templated classes into headers, to
  enable user instantiations with unanticipated types
- Added "-V" option to the meshtool utility app to apply the
  `VariationalSmoother` to the input mesh
- Moved `demangle()` to `libmesh_common.h`.  Any failures in
  `cast_ptr` or `cast_ref` in dbg or devel modes are now reported
  using demangled typenames.
- Fix for return values of `FE::n_quadrature_points()`: after using a
  user-specified list of quadrature points rather than a
  quadrature-rule-generated list, the length of the specified list is
  now correctly returned.  This fixes undefined behavior in
  `JumpErrorEstimator` subclasses with the `integrate_slits` option
  enabled, which fixes a valgrind-detected error and a potential test
  failure in libMesh unit tests.
- Fix for undefined behavior in `SimplexRefiner`.  This similarly
  fixes a libMesh unit test.
- Fix for a Netgen configuration error: configuring the same
  Netgen-enabled libMesh build directory for a second time no longer
  leaves Netgen in an "unbuilt, but marked as built" state.
- Refactoring for simplicity and forward compatibility in Gaussian
  quadrature code
- More assertions

## PETSc-level Changes
