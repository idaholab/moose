## MOOSE Improvements

### `capabilities` parameter in `tests` specs

The MOOSE test harness provides numerous parameters to skip tests depending on capabilities
provided by the current executable. We have checks for the `petsc_version`, `required_submodules`,
the configured `ad_size` etc. Those checks all require custom python functions that parse
configuration files and probe the source tree.

The new [`capabilities` parameter](Capabilities.md) combines all the test harness parameters that probe
built-in functionality of the executable, and provides a flecible boolean expression parser to construct
abitrary conditions that test execution depends on. Capabilities now relies on an application
internal registry that can be queried with the `--show-capabilities` option. For example

```
    min_ad_size = 150
    method = '!dbg'
```

is now

```
    capabilities = 'ad_size>=150 & method!=dbg'
```

Application and module developers can register their own capabilities using the `addCapability` function.
Check `MooseApp::registerCapabilities()` for examples.

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.04.02` Update

- Set nullspace for both J and P operators because PETSc may look at either when setting up linear solves
- No longer need to manually set hypre memory location for PETSc 3.23. This was previously required for MOOSE stack builds with GPU enabled because PETSc's hook into hypre assumed that any configuration enabling GPU support should always run with data structures on device
- Just use `DIFFERENT_NONZERO_PATTERN` in `MatCopy` in `PetscMatrix::operator=`. This is much more robust than using `SAME_NONZERO_PATTERN`
- Assert `verify` calls where appropriate
- Change API name `SparseMatrix::reset_memory` to `SparseMatrix::restore_original_nonzero_pattern`. The new API name better reflects both the focus of the API and also that this API may not perform any memory allocation/deallocation as long as previous fills of the matrix have matched the original preallocation
- Better error message from `System::read_serialized_vectors()` when encountering a difference between the number of vectors we expect to read vs. the number of vectors declared in the XDR header
- Lock at `PetscMatrix` level when doing add/set. This will allow user code to remove their mutex locks around matrix assembly and also saves users who did not previously have proper mutex locking in threaded regions of their code
- Add mutex to fparser `setEpsilon` to prevent thread races
- Add `QBase::get_base_order()` API allowing comparison of multiple quadrature rules independent of p-refinement level
- Update TIMPI submodule
    - Use MPI-4 APIs for `MPI_Count`, i.e. 64-bit, size support, when available
    - Fix for uninitialized warning with gcc 13.3
- Remove phony make code which could trigger multiple netgen builds
- Get metaphysicl config include
- Allow instantiation of `DenseVector::print` with dual numbers
- CheckpointIO can now handle some of the Mesh caches if needed. MOOSE often skips partitioning when doing checkpoint restart, so now at the libMesh level we `recalculate_n_partitions()` and `update_post_partitioning()` when that is the case.
- Add begin/end members to DenseVector allowing for range based looping
- Avoid creating temporary array for hashword2() overload taking 64-bit inputs

## PETSc-level Changes

### `2025.04.02` Update

We updated PETSc to version 3.23. For a summary of changes please see the PETSc [release page](https://petsc.org/release/changes/323/).
