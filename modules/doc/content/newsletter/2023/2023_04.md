## MOOSE Improvements

### Support for mesh repartitioning with stateful material properties

We previously could not handle any repartitioning in problems using
stateful material properties, and so MOOSE disabled repartitioning in
This made adaptive mesh refinement/coarsening (AMR/C) and other mesh
modifying simulation types less efficient in parallel.

Now MOOSE will automatically redistribute stateful material property
data as part of any mesh repartitioning step, using the same
serialization APIs that are also used for restarts, for what should be
seamless backwards compatibility.

One note to watch out for: because simulations with stateful material
properties and AMR/C will now enable repartitioning+redistribution by
default, any *other* application code used in a such a simulation
should be either compatible with those operations, or should itself
disable them.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

Compile-time warnings and run-time PETSc errors triggered by use of
PETSc 3.19 have been fixed.

The `boundary_id_offset` option to `GeneratedMeshGenerator` is now
compatible with distributed meshes.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2023.04.19` Update

- `MeshBase` subclasses now support `operator==` tests, to check geometric
  and subclass type and indexing equality.
- `MeshTools::valid_is_prepared()` test, to help debugging code
  determine whether a mesh modification has left a mesh in an
  unprepared state without either using `prepare_for_use()` or
  `set_isnt_prepared()` to change or indicate that.
- APIs for applying constraints to a nonlinear system assembly in a
  Jacobian-consistent way (as the current `PetscNonlinearSolver`
  does), but at an element-by-element level rather than as a
  post-facto edit of the global residual and Jacobian.  This will
  enable MOOSE to fix a *major* performance bug affecting solves with
  adaptive mesh refinement, strongly-enforced periodic boundary
  conditions, and/or IsoGeometric Analysis meshes.

- TIMPI updates:

  - TIMPI can now be instructed via a C++ API to use older
    synchronization algorithms in `parallel_sync.h` push and pull
    routines, for easier debugging.  libMesh adds a `--timpi-sync=`
    command line option for this.
  - Attempts to send empty vectors in sync routines are now assertion
    failures, since excessive empty sends would be a potential
    performance issue.
  - Code cleanup, extra assertion in the default NBX sync routine.  We
    think we understand what the MPI standard requires of
    synchronous-send operations, but this should help catch the
    problem if any MPI implementations disagree.

- Assorted fixes:

  - `NumericVector::compare()` now handles empty local ranges
  - `ExodusII` edge block reading now handles orientation mismatch
  - `isspace()` is more robust to polluted global namespaces in libMesh
    forks
  - Overzealous assertion about mesh state removed from
    `copy_nodes_and_elements`
  - `LinearPartitioner` is now idempotent on distributed meshes
  - PETSc 3.19 compatibility
