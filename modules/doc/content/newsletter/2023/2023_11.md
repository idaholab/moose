## MOOSE Improvements

### Coordinate transformations during transfers between applications

General coordinate transformations between applications have been implemented in the
[MultiAppGeneralField](MultiAppGeneralFieldTransfer.md)-derived transfers. This enables transfers between
from RZ to XYZ geometries, for example, or accounting for arbitrary rotations (defined in the `[Mesh]` blocks)
when transferring between applications.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2023.11.06` Update

- Added low-order `RAVIART_THOMAS` finite element support, including
  general H(div) mapping support for future divergence-conforming
  finite element families.  Added `L2_RAVIART_THOMAS` support for the
  broken/L2 version of that space.  Example codes for each, using mixed
  and hybridized formulations.
- Option to remove a boundary id globally from a mesh without
  re-preparing it afterward
- Option to merge subdomains when stitching meshes based on inspection
  of both subdomain ids and subdomain names
- Better matching of input file ids when reading Abaqus files
- Fixes for independent control over which variables see p-refinement
- Added `QBase::clone()` method
- Added parameter for user-supplied hash when doing Just-In-Time
  compilation with fparser
- Added `Packing` specializations for `Eigen` matrices; this enables
  parallel communication of these classes and of many derived types
  including them.
- Bug fixes for nodal interpolation of rational elements; this
  corrects an error in VTK output of many IsoGeometric Analysis mesh
  results.
- Bug fix for overzealous caching of rational elements' shape
  functions.  This corrects an error in computation on many
  IsoGeometric Analysis meshes
- Bug fixes for refinement of Tet14 elements.
- More robust `reduced_basis` EIM error indicator calculations
- Higher-order default quadrature choice in integration-based error
  estimators and error indicators, avoiding underintegration on
  superconvergent results
- Removal of Fortran/C++ detection for HDF5 libraries, so we can more
  easily find the desired C HDF5 library we do use.
- Upgrade to latest autotools versions in libMesh, TIMPI, and
  MetaPhysicL
- Update VTK compatibility to support VTK 9.3
- GCC warning workarounds to allow --enable-werror builds with -Wextra
  in GCC 13
- Minor refactoring in Threads/PerfLog interactions
- More parallel synchronization assertions during System setup and
  update operations
- Minor fixes to documentation, comments, and unit tests, including
  VexCL-enabled unit tests of MetaPhysicL
