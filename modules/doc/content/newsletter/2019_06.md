## Revamped Mortar FEM

`MortarConstraint` has been revamped. Mortar now relies on an `AutomaticMortarGeneration` object
that, as its name suggests, automatically generates a mortar segment mesh for performing
integrations. For static mesh problems the mortar segment mesh generation is done once upon initial
setup. For dynamic problems with a displaced mesh, mortar mesh generation is done every residual
evaluation. We have verified that the new mortar system satisfies *a prior* error estimates, e.g.
in the L2 norm we observe order 3 and order 2.5 convergence for the primal and lagrange multiplier
variables respectively for a P2P1 discretization, as well as 2 and 1.5 for P1P1 and P1P0. Plots of
these results as well as some technical discussion can be found on the mortar
[github issue](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/13080). Additionally, an excellent overview
of the mortar implementation is given in
[this technical report](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1468630/). Examples of using the new mortar
constraint can be found in the `$MOOSE_DIR/test/tests/mortar` directory. These examples demonstrate
use of mortar with conforming and non-conforming meshes, as well as for periodic boundary
conditions. Physics examples include solution continuity, thermal, and mechanical contact. In the
latter case a finite difference Jacobian is used; however, a
[follow-on PR](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/13508) will demonstrate use of automatic
differentiation and PJFNK for solving frictionless and frictional contact with the new mortar
constraint system.

## PorousFlow: Reduction of Numerical Diffusion

A new type of numerical stabilization has been added to PorousFlow to complement the existing "full upwind" and "no stabilization" choices.  The aim is to reduce numerical diffusion.  The code is based on the theoretical work of Kuzmin and Turek.  Users are strongly encouraged to experiment with this new feature so we can collectively learn the strengths and weaknesses in real simulations.  Only [minor changes to input files](porous_flow/kt.md) are needed to activate the new stabilization.  The numerical stabilization [lead page](porous_flow/stabilization.md) lists pros and cons of various stabilization schemes and provides links to pages that explain and quantify numerical diffusion.

## Stochastic Tools "Batch" Mode

The [Stochastic Tools module](stochastic_tools/index.md) now includes the ability to run
full and transient solves using "batch" mode, which is useful when a MultiApp contains
a large number of sub-applications. In batch mode the MultiApp creates a single sub-application
and re-uses it to perform the multiple simulations, allowing for reduced memory usage when
compared to the default behavior. For more information please refer to [batch_mode.md].

## PETSc Upgrade
PETSc is upgraded to 3.10.5 for moose users, and the new version provides a better performance.
We encourage moose users to use this new version.  PETSc submodule for moose developers and
advanced users is upgraded to 3.11.2. PETSc submodule has been tested on the framework level.

## Conservative Transfer
`Conservative Transfer` has been added to MOOSE to support transfer a physics quantity
  in a conservative way. `Conservative Transfer` currently works with `MultiAppMeshFunctionTransfer`,
  `MultiAppInterpolationTransfer`, `MultiAppNearestNodeTransfer` and `MultiAppUserObjectTransfer`.
