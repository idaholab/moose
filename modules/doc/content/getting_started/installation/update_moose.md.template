## Staying Up To Date id=update

!style! halign=left
MOOSE does not use traditional versioning, is under heavy development, and is being updated
continuously. Therefore, it is important that you continue to update MOOSE as you use it to develop
your application(s); weekly updates are recommended.
!style-end!

*If this is your first day with MOOSE, you are already up to date. Come back in a week!*

Update MOOSE repository:

```bash
cd {{PATH}}/moose
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```

Then return to your application, re-compile, and test:

```bash
cd {{PATH}}/YourAppName
make clobberall
make -j4
./run_tests -j4
```
