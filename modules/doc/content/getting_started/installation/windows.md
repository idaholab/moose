# Windows Subsystem for Linux

!alert! warning
Using MOOSE on Windows 10 and 11 is experimental and not fully supported.

Caveats:

- Peacock does not work correctly (artifacts during rendering: surface normals are flipped).

!! double space on purpose to emphasize important bullet point below

- Different flavors of Linux are available, but +we STRONGLY urge the use of Ubuntu version
  20.04.x LTS.+ Use other Linux flavors and versions at your peril if you are interested in using
  Peacock. Issues usually involve incompatible system-supplied OpenGL/mesa libraries when used with
  our Conda packages. Or, system packages that are required might be missing, yet we are unfamiliar
  with which ones to ask you to install.
!alert-end!

!include installation/wsl.md

### Close the WSL terminal

!style! halign=left
With the above complete, close the WSL terminal and re-open it. Proceed to follow (or return to) any
of the Linux instructions on our
[Getting Started](getting_started/installation/index.md optional=True) page.
!style-end!

## Tips

- Like WSL installation, the following sections require performing all commands in a PowerShell or
  Command Prompt in *administrator* mode!
- Your Download's folder while using WSL is located at: `/mnt/c/Users/<Your User Name>/Downloads`

### Updating the WSL Linux Kernel

!style! halign=left
The WSL linux kernel receives periodic updates. To perform these updates, one can run:
!style-end!

```bash
wsl --update
```

### Change WSL Version

!style! halign=left
In this instruction set, WSL version 2 is used (and is the default, recommended release). If WSL
version 1 is desired, this can be changed by performing the command:
!style-end!

```bash
wsl --set-version 1
```

The default for new Linux kernel instances can be set by performing the following:

```bash
wsl --set-default-version n
```

where `n` can be replaced by either 1 or 2, depending on the version desired.

### Shutdown All WSL Instances

!style! halign=left
To shutdown all instances of WSL on the machine, perform the following:
!style-end!

```bash
wsl --shutdown
```

WSL can then be restarted from the Start menu.
