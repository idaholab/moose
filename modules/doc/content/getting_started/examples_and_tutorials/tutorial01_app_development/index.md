# Tutorial 1: Application Development id=tutorial-1

In this tutorial, the reader shall work through the steps to create a custom MOOSE-based application to solve real-world physics problems. The instructions begin with defining the problem and converting the governing [!ac](PDEs) into an expression compatible with MOOSE. As the tutorial progresses, the core C++ classes that are available to developers for solving problems, as well as the basic systems of MOOSE, will be discussed.

This tutorial is the focus of the live hosted [examples_and_tutorials/index.md#workshop]. New users are encouraged to engage themselves in this training by +reading the content carefully and reproducing the steps, without simply copying and pasting code+. This tutorial is designed to be an in-depth explanation of creating a complete, custom multiphysics application including the process of using a repository and testing.
