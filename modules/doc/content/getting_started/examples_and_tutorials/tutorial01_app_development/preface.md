!!!
NOTE: These screenshots were captured with the Shutter application (shutter-project.org)

The borders and shadow were then produced by running the following shell script:

```
convert -border 8 -bordercolor 'rgb(0,88,151)' $1 $2

convert $2 \( +clone -background '#7A7777' -shadow 88x5+0+5 \) +swap \
	-background none -layers merge +repage $2
```

The images were then scaled to the page width based on the widest image resolution (breadcrumbs.png)

TODO: a nice border/shadow tool for MooseDocs media would be nice
