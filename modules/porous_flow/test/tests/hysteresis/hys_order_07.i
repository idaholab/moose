# Test that PorousFlowHysteresisOrder correctly calculates hysteresis order
# Hysteresis order is initialised = 3, with turning points = (0.5, 0.8, 0.66)
# Initial saturation is 0.71
# Water is removed from the system (so order = 3) until saturation = 0.66
# Then, water is removed from the system (so order = 2) until saturation = 0.65
# Then, water is added to the system (so order = 3 with turning point = 0.65) until saturation = 0.8
# Then, water is added to the system (so order = 1) until saturation = 1
# Then, water is added to the system (so order = 0)
