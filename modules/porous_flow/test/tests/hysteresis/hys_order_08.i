# Test that PorousFlowHysteresisOrder correctly calculates hysteresis order
# Hysteresis order is initialised = 3, with turning points = (0.5, 0.8, 0.66)
# Initial saturation is 0.71
# A large amount of water is removed in one timestep so the saturation becomes 0.58 (and order = 0)
# Then, water is added to the system (order = 1, with turning point = 0.58) until saturation = 0.67
# Then, a large amount of water is removed from the system so order becomes 0
