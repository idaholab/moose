# Checking that gravity head is established
# 1phase, 2-component, constant fluid-bulk, constant viscosity, constant permeability
# fully saturated with fully-saturated Kernel
# For better agreement with the analytical solution (ana_pp), just increase nx
# NOTE: the numerics described by this input file is quite delicate.  Firstly, the steady-state solution does not depend on the mass-fraction distribution, so the mass-fraction variable can assume any values (with the constraint that its integral is the same as the initial condition).  Secondly, because the PorousFlowFullySaturatedDarcyFlow does no upwinding, the steady-state porepressure distribution can contain non-physical oscillations.  The solver choice and mesh choice used below mean the result is as expected, but changing these can produce different results.
