# Tests that PorousFlow can successfully recover using a checkpoint file.
# This test contains stateful material properties, adaptivity, integrated
# boundary conditions with nodal-sized materials, and TVD flux limiting.
#
# This test file is run three times:
# 1) The full input file is run to completion
# 2) The input file is run for half the time and checkpointing is included
# 3) The input file is run in recovery using the checkpoint data
#
# The final output of test 3 is compared to the final output of test 1 to verify
# that recovery was successful.
