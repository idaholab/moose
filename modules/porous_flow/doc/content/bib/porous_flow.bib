abstract = {Semi-analytical or closed analytical solutions of the stationary thermo-hydro-mechanical fields can be obtained if the fields are stationary and the geometry is cylindrical or spherical. The fundamental difficulty of the problem is the non-linear convective term that appears in the heat transport equation. If Peclet's number is small, the problem can be treated as a regular perturbation problem, and the zeroth and first order perturbation terms are rather easily derived in closed form. If the strain is plane, the choice of boundary conditions at the outer boundary has a strong influence on the solution. The difference between the solutions for plane and spherical strain is considerable, not only far from but also near the heat source.}

ABSTRACT = {Predicting and characterising groundwater flow and solute transport in engineering and hydrogeological applications, such as dimensioning tracer experiments, rely primarily on numerical modelling techniques. During software selection for numerical modelling, the accuracy of the results, financial costs of the simulation software, and computational resources should be considered. This study evaluates numerical modelling approaches and outlines the advantages and disadvantages of several simulators in terms of predictability, temporal control, and computational efficiency conducted in a single user and single computational resource set-up. A set of well-established flow and transport modelling simulators, such as MODFLOW/MT3DMS, FEFLOW, COMSOL Multiphysics, and DuMuX were tested and compared. These numerical simulators are based on three numerical discretisation schemes, i.e., finite difference (FD), finite element (FE), and finite volume (FV). The influence of dispersivity, potentially an artefact of numerical modelling (numerical dispersion), was investigated in parametric studies, and results are compared with analytical solutions. At the same time, relative errors were assessed for a complex field scale example. This comparative study reveals that the FE-based simulators COMSOL and FEFLOW show higher accuracy for a specific range of dispersivities under forced gradient conditions than DuMuX and MODFLOW/MT3DMS. FEFLOW performs better than COMSOL in regard to computational time both in single-core and multi-core computing. Overall computational time is lowest for the FD-based simulator MODFLOW/MT3DMS while the number of mesh elements is low (here &lt; 12,800 elements). However, for finer discretisation, FE software FEFLOW performs faster.},

abstract = {Large-scale subsurface hydrogen storage in porous formations may play a crucial role in the future energy system. While numerical simulation has been used to assess hydrogen storage, simulators have not been proven to be reliable and accurate by a systematic and detailed code comparison. The hypothesis of this work is that codes will perform similarly with results within 5%. In this study, five numerical simulators were used to simulate a suite of test problems of increasing complexity applicable to subsurface hydrogen storage in porous formations. Intercomparison of results showed a good quantitative agreement of predicted molar fractions, saturations or phase pressures, with only subtle differences arising due to the details of fluid properties and numerical discretization approaches. This intercomparison analysis thereby builds confidence in numerical simulation for subsurface hydrogen storage and provides a basis for more complex scenarios including geomechanical or geochemical effects.}

abstract = {Numerical simulators were exercised on a suite of test problems for CO2 disposal in saline aquifers and depleting oil and gas reservoirs. Intercomparison of results reveals broad agreement in most areas, but also points out sensitivities to fluid properties and discretization approaches that need further study. Currently available simulation codes were shown capable of modeling the complex phenomena accompanying geologic storage of CO2 in a robust manner, and with quantitatively similar results.}
