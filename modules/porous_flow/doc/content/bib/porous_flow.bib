abstract = {Semi-analytical or closed analytical solutions of the stationary thermo-hydro-mechanical fields can be obtained if the fields are stationary and the geometry is cylindrical or spherical. The fundamental difficulty of the problem is the non-linear convective term that appears in the heat transport equation. If Peclet's number is small, the problem can be treated as a regular perturbation problem, and the zeroth and first order perturbation terms are rather easily derived in closed form. If the strain is plane, the choice of boundary conditions at the outer boundary has a strong influence on the solution. The difference between the solutions for plane and spherical strain is considerable, not only far from but also near the heat source.}

ABSTRACT = {Predicting and characterising groundwater flow and solute transport in engineering and hydrogeological applications, such as dimensioning tracer experiments, rely primarily on numerical modelling techniques. During software selection for numerical modelling, the accuracy of the results, financial costs of the simulation software, and computational resources should be considered. This study evaluates numerical modelling approaches and outlines the advantages and disadvantages of several simulators in terms of predictability, temporal control, and computational efficiency conducted in a single user and single computational resource set-up. A set of well-established flow and transport modelling simulators, such as MODFLOW/MT3DMS, FEFLOW, COMSOL Multiphysics, and DuMuX were tested and compared. These numerical simulators are based on three numerical discretisation schemes, i.e., finite difference (FD), finite element (FE), and finite volume (FV). The influence of dispersivity, potentially an artefact of numerical modelling (numerical dispersion), was investigated in parametric studies, and results are compared with analytical solutions. At the same time, relative errors were assessed for a complex field scale example. This comparative study reveals that the FE-based simulators COMSOL and FEFLOW show higher accuracy for a specific range of dispersivities under forced gradient conditions than DuMuX and MODFLOW/MT3DMS. FEFLOW performs better than COMSOL in regard to computational time both in single-core and multi-core computing. Overall computational time is lowest for the FD-based simulator MODFLOW/MT3DMS while the number of mesh elements is low (here &lt; 12,800 elements). However, for finer discretisation, FE software FEFLOW performs faster.},
