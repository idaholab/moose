# Material laws

Several important material properties and constitutive equations are implemented in PorousFlow.
Detailed descriptions of these are provided in the following:

- [Capillary pressure](porous_flow/capillary_pressure.md)
- [Relative permeability](relative_permeability.md)
- [Permeability](porous_flow/permeability.md)
- [Porosity](/porous_flow/porosity.md)
- [Diffusivity](diffusivity.md)
- [Hysteretic capillary pressure and relative permeability](hysteresis.md)
