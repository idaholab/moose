# Inclined Crack in Infinite Plate

The following example follows from [!citet](Dolbow99,Richardson2011) where the stress intensity factors for a plate with an angled center crack is subjected to a far-field load in the y-direction.   The analytic solution for the stress intensity factors of the configuration shown in [!ref](stress) is given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    KI &= \sigma\sqrt{\pi a} \cos^2(\theta) \\
    KII &= \sigma\sqrt{\pi a} \cos(\theta)\sin(\theta)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where the crack angle with respect to the x-axis is $\theta$, the crack length is $a$ and the far-field load $\sigma$.  Convergence with global mesh refinement to the analytic solution is shown for a range of crack orientations in [!ref](convergence).  The values for $KI$ in blue show better convergence than $KII$ shown in red for mixed mode loading of the crack-tip when $20^\circ\ge\theta\le80^\circ$.  [!ref](qintegral) shows the q-function for integrating the J-integral.  Incorrectly specifying the radii for the q-function will lead to inaccurate calculation of the J-integral and stress intensity factors.  The q-function should exclude a few elements around the crack tip where $q=1$.  The q-function radii are designated in the `DomainIntegral` block shown in [!ref](input).  This example uses a cutter mesh, shown by the white line in [!ref](stress), to create the initial crack using the `MeshCut2DFractureUserObject` object, also shown in [!ref](input).
