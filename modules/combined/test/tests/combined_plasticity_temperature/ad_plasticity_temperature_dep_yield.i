#
# This is a test of the piece-wise linear strain hardening model using the
# small strain formulation.  This test exercises the temperature-dependent
# yield stress.
#
# Test procedure:
# 1. The element is pulled to and then beyond the yield stress for a given
# temperature.
# 2. The displacement is then constant while the temperature increases and
# the yield stress decreases.  This results in a lower stress with more
# plastic strain.
# 3. The temperature decreases beyond its original value giving a higher
# yield stress.  The displacement increases, causing increases stress to
# the new yield stress.
# 4. The temperature and yield stress are constant with increasing
# displacement giving a constant stress and more plastic strain.
#
# Plotting total_strain_yy on the x axis and stress_yy on the y axis shows
# the stress history in a clear way.
