#
# Patch test for 1D spherical elements
#
# The 1D mesh is pinned at x=0.  The displacement at the outer node is set to
#   3e-3*X where X is the x-coordinate of that node.  That gives a strain of
#   3e-3 for the x, y, and z directions.
#
# Young's modulus is 1e6, and Poisson's ratio is 0.25.  This gives:
#
# Stress xx, yy, zz = E/(1+nu)/(1-2nu)*strain*((1-nu) + nu + nu) = 6000
