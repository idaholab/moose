#
# This problem is taken from the Abaqus verification manual:
#   "1.5.4 Patch test for axisymmetric elements"
# The stress solution is given as:
#   xx = yy = zz = 19900
#   xy = 0
#
# If strain = log(1+1e-2) = 0.00995033...
# then
# stress = E/(1+PR)/(1-2*PR)*(1-PR +PR +PR)*strain = 19900.6617
# with E = 1e6 and PR = 0.25.
#
# The code computes stress = 19900.6617 when
# increment_calculation = eigen.  There is a small error when the
# rashidapprox option is used.
#
# Since the strain is 1e-3 in all three directions, the new density should be
#   new_density = original_density * V_0 / V
#   new_density = 0.283 / (1 + 9.95e-3 + 9.95e-3 + 9,95e-3) = 0.2747973
#
# The code computes a new density of .2746770
