# This test is a simpified coupled case between the electromagnetic and
# heat transfer modules. While the file microwave_heating.i is a test
# utilizing the method of manufactured solutions, where both real and
# complex components of the electromagnetic properties are provided
# (such that no term is zeroed out), this test involves only the
# real components of the electromagnetic properties. In particular,
# this test supplies the fusing current to a copper wire and simulations
# the spatial and temporal heating profile until the wire reaches its
# melting point. The PDE's of this test file are as follows:
#
#   curl(curl(A)) + j*mu*omega*(sigma*A) = J
#   mag(E) = mag(-j*omega*A) + mag(J/sigma)
#   rho*C*dT/dt - div(k*grad(T)) = Q
#   Q = 0.5*sigma*mag(E)^2
#
# Where:
#   - A is the magnetic vector potential
#   - j is the sqrt(-1)
#   - mu is the permeability of free space
#   - omega is the angular frequency of the system
#   - sigma is the electric conductivity of the wire
#   - J is the supplied DC current
#   - E is the electric field
#   - rho is the density of copper
#   - C is the heat capacity of copper
#   - T is the temperature
#   - k is the thermal conductivity of the wire
#   - Q is the Joule heating
#
# The BCs are as follows:
#
#   curl(n) x curl(A) = 0,  where n is the normal vector
#   q * n = h (T - T_infty), where q is the heat flux,
#                            h is the convective heat transfer coefficient,
#                            and T_infty is the far-field temperature.
