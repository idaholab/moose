# Test designed to compare results and active time between SH/LinearStrainHardening
# material vs TM j2 plastic user object. As number of elements increases, TM
# active time increases at a much higher rate than SM. Testing at 4x4x4
# (64 elements).
#
# plot vm_stress vs intnl to see constant hardening
#
# Original test located at:
# solid_mechanics/tests/j2_plasticity/hard1.i
