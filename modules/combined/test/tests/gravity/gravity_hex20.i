# Gravity Test
#
# This test is designed to exercise the gravity body force kernel.
#
# The mesh for this problem is a rectangular bar 10 units by 1 unit
#   by 1 unit.
#
# The boundary conditions for this problem are as follows.  The
#   displacement is zero on each of side that faces a negative
#   coordinate direction.  The acceleration of gravity is 20.
#
# The material has a Young's modulus of 1e6 and a density of 2.
#
# The analytic solution for the displacement along the bar is:
#
# u(x) = -b*x^2/(2*E)+b*L*x/E
#
# The displacement at x=L is b*L^2/(2*E) = 2*20*10*10/(2*1e6) = 0.002.
#
# The analytic solution for the stress along the bar assuming linear
#   elasticity is:
#
# S(x) = b*(L-x)
#
# The stress at x=0 is b*L = 2*20*10 = 400.
#
# Note:  The simulation does not measure stress at x=0.  The stress
#   is reported at element centers.  The element closest to x=0 sits
#   at x = 1/4 and has a stress of 390.  This matches the linear
#   stress distribution that is expected.  The same situation applies
#   at x = L where the stress is zero analytically.  The nearest
#   element is at x=9.75 where the stress is 10.
