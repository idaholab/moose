# Flow around a cylinder (2D) benchmark validation case
# This example showcases a flow around a cylinder which results in vortex
# shedding. The problem specification has been taken from the following paper:
#
# @incollection{schafer1996benchmark,
#   title={Benchmark computations of laminar flow around a cylinder},
#   author={Sch{\"a}fer, Michael and Turek, Stefan and Durst, Franz and Krause, Egon and Rannacher, Rolf},
#   booktitle={Flow simulation with high-performance computers II},
#   pages={547--566},
#   year={1996},
#   publisher={Springer}
# }
# The Reyndols number is Re=100.
# The expected Strouhal number (St) is in the [0.2950, 0.3050] range, with
# refinement=8, we expect to get St=0.2941 with the model below.
# Run it using the following command:
# ./navier_stokes-opt -i header.i mesh.i flow_over_circle.i executioner_postprocessor.i
