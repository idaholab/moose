# Simple equilibrium reaction example to illustrate the use of the AqueousEquilibriumReactions
# action.
# In this example, a single primary species a is transported by diffusion and convection
# from the left of the porous medium, reacting to form an equilibrium species pa2 according to
# the equilibrium reaction specified in the AqueousEquilibriumReactions block as:
#
#  reactions = '2a = pa2 1'
#
# where the 2 is the weight of the equilibrium species, and the 1 refers to the equilibrium
# constant (log10(Keq) = 1).
#
# The AqueousEquilibriumReactions action creates all the required kernels and auxkernels
# to compute the reaction given by the above equilibrium reaction equation.
#
# Specifically, it adds to following:
# * An AuxVariable named 'pa2' (given in the reactions equations)
# * A AqueousEquilibriumRxnAux AuxKernel for this AuxVariable with all parameters
# * A CoupledBEEquilibriumSub Kernel for each primary species with all parameters
# * A CoupledDiffusionReactionSub Kernel for each primary species with all parameters
# * A CoupledConvectionReactionSub Kernel for each primary species with all parameters if
# pressure is a coupled variable
