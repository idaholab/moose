# The `geochemistry` module: tests and examples

The theory behind the `geochemistry` module has been described mostly in the [equilibrium](equilibrium.md) and [transport](transport.md) pages.  It is hoped that the descriptions of tests and examples found below will help users actually implement their geochemical models.

Most of the tests and examples are drawn from [!cite](bethke_2007)
