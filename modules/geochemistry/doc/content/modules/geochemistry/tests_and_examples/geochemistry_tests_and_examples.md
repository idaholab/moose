# The `geochemistry` module: tests and examples

The theory behind the `geochemistry` module has been described mostly in the [equilibrium](equilibrium.md) and [transport](transport.md) pages.  It is hoped that the descriptions of tests and examples found below will help users actually implement their geochemical models.

Most of the tests and examples are drawn from [!cite](bethke_2007)

## Equilibrium models of various waters

- [Chemical model of seawater](seawater.md)
- [Water in the Amazon river](amazon.md)
- [Red Sea bine](red_sea.md)

## Models with redox disequilibrium

- [Morro de Ferro groundwater](morro.md)
- [Microbial respiration](microbial_redox.md)

## Exploring solubility and activities

- [Solubility of gypsum](gypsum.md)
- [Saturation of halite and anhydrite at Sebkhat El Melah](sebkhat.md)

## Sorption and surface complexation

- [Langmuir sorption of selenate in loamy soil](selenate.md)
- [A problem involving surface complexation](surface_complexation.md)
