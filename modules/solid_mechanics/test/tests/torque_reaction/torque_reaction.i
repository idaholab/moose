# Scalar torque reaction

# This test computes the sum of the torques acting on a ten element 2D bar mesh
# and is intended to replicate the classical wrench problem from statics.
# A displacement in the y along the right face is applied to the bar end to create
# a shear force along the bar end. The rotation origin default (the global origin)
# and the axis of rotation direction vector used to compute the torque reaction
# is set to (0, 0, 1) out of the plane.
# Torque is calculated for the two nodes on the left of the bar. For the bottom
# node on the right, the torque/ moment lever is the x coordinate value, and for
# the top node on the right the torque lever is the hypotenuse of the x and y
# coordinates.  The expected sum of the torque reaction is just over 37.
