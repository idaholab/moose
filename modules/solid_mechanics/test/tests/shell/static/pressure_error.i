# Test for the stress and strain output for tapered shell elements.
# A tapered beam is represented with shell elements in XY plane
# having Young's Modulus of 210000 and poissons ratio of 0.3.
# The displacement in X direction is constrained in the left end and the
# displacement of center node of the left end is constrained in Y direction.
# Previous case: A uniform pressure of 50 units is applied at the right end.
# The shell element strain calculation assumes four quadrature points.
# So, when a pressure is applied at the edge, two quadrature points
# are used in the strain calulator and an error is generated.
# Change to the test: using a PressureBC does not cause material property evaluations
# anymore. So a MatNeumannBC is used instead
