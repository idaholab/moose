# Test for displacement of pinched cylinder
# Ref: Figure 10 and Table 6 from Dvorkin and Bathe, Eng. Comput., Vol. 1, 1984.

# A cylinder of radius 1 m and length 2 m (along Z axis) with clamped ends
# (at z = 0 and 2 m) is pinched at mid-length by placing point loads of 10 N
# at (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1). Due to the symmetry of the problem, only 1/8th
# of the cylinder needs to be modeled.

# The normalized series solution for the displacement at the loading point is
# w = Wc E t / P = 164.24; where Wc is the displacement in m, E is the Young's
# modulus, t is the thickness and P is the point load.

# For this problem, E = 1e6 Pa, L = 2 m, R = 1 m, t = 0.01 m, P = 10 N and
# Poisson's ratio = 0.3. This gives an analytic displacement of 0.16424 m.
# FEM results from different mesh discretizations are presented below. Only
# the 10x10 mesh is included as a test.

# As shown in the table below, the results from the MOOSE FEM analysis converge
# to the analytic solution and the convergence matches well with the results
# of Dvorkin and Bathe (1984).
