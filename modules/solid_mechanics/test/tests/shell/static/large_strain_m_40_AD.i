# Large strain/rotation test for shell elements

# A cantilever beam that is 40 m long (Y direction) with 1 m x 1 m
# cross-section is modeled using 5 shell elements placed along its
# length. The bottom boundary is fixed in all displacements and
# rotations. A load of 0.140625 N is applied at each node on the top
# boundary, resulting in a total load of 0.28125 N. E = 1800 Pa and
# v = 0.0.

# The reference solution for large deflection of this beam is based on
# K. E. Bisshopp and D.C. Drucker, Quaterly of Applied Mathematics,
# Vol 3, No. # 3, 1945.

# For PL^2/EI = 3, disp_z at tip = 0.6L = 24 m & disp_y at tip = 0.76*L-L = -9.6 m

# The FEM solution at tip of cantilever is:
# disp_z = 24.85069 m; relative error = 3.54 %
# disp_y = -9.125937 m; relative error = 5.19 %
