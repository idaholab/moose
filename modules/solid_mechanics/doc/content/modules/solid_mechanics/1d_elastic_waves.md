# Frequency Domain Analysis

The MOOSE Solid Mechanics module performs frequency domain analysis using modal analysis and frequency response functions. The following example will go
through both options.


## Modal Analysis

Modal analysis is a technique used in structural dynamics to determine the
natural frequencies (eigenvalues) and mode shapes (eigenvectors) of a structure.
The natural frequencies represent the frequencies at which the structure tends
to vibrate when subjected to a disturbance, while the mode shapes describe the
corresponding deformed shape of the structure at each natural frequency. Modal
analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of a structure and
is often used for design, optimization, and troubleshooting purposes.

The general eigenvalue problem that needs to be solved for modal analysis is given by:
\begin{equation}
(\mathbf{A} - \omega^2 \mathbf{B})\mathbf{u} = 0
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}$ holds the "noneigen" kernels, $\mathbf{B}$ holds the "eigen" kernels, $\omega$ are the natural frequencies, and $\mathbf{u}$ are the mode shapes.
In MOOSE, modal analysis is set up using the [Eigenvalue.md] Executioner. The
Eigenvalue System allows you to define which kernels go into which matrix. It's important
to note that in modal analysis, Neumann boundary conditions are
ignored since we are interested in the free vibration response of the structure.
Only Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered.

To demonstrate modal analysis in MOOSE, we will visit the cantilever beam example that will be discussed in more detail in the next section on frequency response functions. The goal here is to calculate the first few natural frequencies and visualize the corresponding mode shapes of the cantilever beam.
The strong form for the modal analysis of the cantilever beam is:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\mathbf{u}) = -\rho \omega^2 \mathbf{u}
\end{equation}
This equation represents the generalized eigenvalue problem for modal analysis.
The terms on the left side, which involve the stress divergence, will contribute
to the "A" matrix, and the terms on the right side, which are the mass terms, will contribute
to the "B" matrix.


## Cantilever Beam Example

The cantilever beam shown in [cantilever] is subjected to a time harmonic force on the right side in the out-of-plane and vertical directions.  In this example the frequency of the time varying load is swept over a range.  The displacement at the midpoint of the beam is recorded at each frequency.  This type of output, displacement as a function of frequency, is a frequency response function (FRF) or transfer function.  Frequencies corresponding to the displacement peaks in the FRF indicate natural frequencies/modes.

The analytic solution for the free vibration of a cantilever is known, see [Euler Bernoulli beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Bernoulli_beam_theory).  The analytic eigenvalues, $\omega_n$, are given by
\begin{equation}
  \omega_n=k^2_n\sqrt\frac{EI^2}{\rho A L^4}
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $A$ the cross sectional area, $L$ the beam length, and $k_n$ are the wave numbers.
For a cantilever beam, the first three wave numbers, $k_n$, given for the Euler Bernoulli beam dimensions given as the dimensions of the cantilever beam are $L=$1m with cross section dimensions $a=$0.1m and $b=$0.15m are\\
$k_1=1.875$\\
$k_2=4.694$\\
$k_3=7.855$\\
The moment of inertia for a rectangular cross section beam is $I=\frac{wh^3}{12}$, where $h$ is the dimension in the direction being loaded and $w$ is the other cross sectional dimension.

For an aluminum cantilever beam, $E=$68e9 Pa, $\nu=$0.36, $\rho=$27.e3 kg/m$^3$.
The analytic first and second natural frequencies for this system bending in directions tangential to the beam axis are:\\
$\omega_{1a}=$509Hz\\
$\omega_{1b}=$763Hz\\
Both of these frequencies use the same value of $k_1$, but with the moment of inertia recomputed for bending about the different widths, where the lower frequency is the first bending mode about the thin direction ($h=a=$0.1m) and the next higher frequency is the first bending mode about the thicker direction ($h=b=$0.15m).


## Modal Analysis: Cantilever Beam Example

In the Kernels block, we define the kernels that contribute to the "A" and "B"
matrices in the eigenvalue problem. The StressDivergenceTensor kernels represent the stress divergence terms and contribute to the "A"
matrix. The ADCoefReaction kernels
represent the mass terms and contribute to the "B" matrix. The
[!param](/Kernels/CoefReaction/coefficient) in [kernels/CoefReaction.md] is set
to a negative value which corresponds to a positive density. The
`extra_residual_tags = 'eigen'` parameter is used to indicate that these kernels
contribute to "B" matrix. In other literature the A matrix would be the
stiffness matrix (K) and B would be the Mass matrix (M).

Kernels for A and B

The BCs block defines the boundary conditions for the problem. In this example,
we have Dirichlet boundary conditions applied to the left boundary for all
displacement components. The [DirichletBC.md] is used for the "A" matrix, while
the [EigenDirichletBC.md] is used for the "B" matrix. Where ever a
[DirichletBC.md] is used, an [EigenDirichletBC.md] should be set also.

matrix A and B.

The Executioner block specifies the eigenvalue solver settings. The `type =
Eigenvalue` indicates that we are solving an eigenvalue problem. Since we are
solving a linear eigenvalue problem we can use a
[!param](/Executioner/Eigenvalue/solve_type) that can get multiple eigenvalues
at once, in this case that is `KRYLOVSCHUR`. The
[!param](/Executioner/Eigenvalue/which_eigen_pairs) parameter determines which
eigenvalues to compute and for modal analysis the smallest eigenvalues are usually of interest. The
[!param](/Executioner/Eigenvalue/n_eigen_pairs) parameter sets the number of eigenvalue pairs to compute.

caption=Eigenvalue Executioner

To output all the eigenvalues solved in the system we can use the
[vectorpostprocessors/Eigenvalues.md] vectorpostprocessor. While we have solved for the two smallest
eigenvalues, currently MOOSE only has the ability to output a single eigenvector. To
change which eigenvector is outputted adjust the index in
[!param](/Problem/EigenProblem/active_eigen_index) and rerun the simulation.

For this coarse mesh example, we were able to determine the first two
$\omega$'s: 645.1 Hz and 855 Hz. Which are close to the theoretical result of
509 Hz and 763 Hz, and as the mesh is refined the results would converge on to the
true solutions. The results are similar to the frequency response function as
long as the sweeps are granular enough. The second mode is visualized in
[mode2], and the outline of the undeformed state is shown in black.

## Frequency Response Function

The following example presents two frequency domain analysis of a cantilever beam done in the MOOSE Solid Mechanics module. The first example computes a frequency response function of the cantilever beam and identifies the first two eigenvalues of beam.  The second analysis computes the dynamic response at a single frequency (time-harmonic problem).
A frequency domain analysis provides the structural response at a discrete set of frequencies. At each frequency, an independent steady state simulation is performed. This document provides an example of modeling a dynamic problem at a single frequency (time-harmonic problem).

Frequency domain analysis is often used to determine a frequency response function (FRF). An FRF describes the relationship between an input (frequency and amplitude of the input forcing source) and output (displacement response of a system). For simple systems, an analytic FRF can be derived. For more complex systems, the FRF is numerically obtained by determining the system response over a range of frequencies. The frequencies corresponding to the peaks on the FRF plot indicate natural frequencies of the system (eigen/fundamental frequencies). The mode shape (eigenvector) is given by the displacement profile at a natural frequency.

Other applications of frequency domain dynamics are: (1) computation of band structure (dispersion curves) of lattices/metamaterial, (2) inverse design for vibration control, e.g. design a system so that it has as minimum/maximum response at particular frequency, (3) material properties inversion/optimization given discrete responses.

Frequency domain analyses can be advantageous over its time domain counterpart in several cases, for example, when the frequency spectrum of a signal consists of a few frequencies, or, when it is needed to have a better control of the numerical dispersion.

## Problem Description

The equations of motion for a one dimensional isotropic elastic solid is given by the following partial differential equation:
\begin{equation}
    -E\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\rho \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}=0
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, and $\rho$ is the density.
To convert to the frequency domain, we consider that a plane wave given by
\begin{equation}
  u(x,t)= B e^{i(\omega t - k x)}
  \label{eq2}
\end{equation}
is a solution to [eq1] where $B$ is in general a complex number depending on the boundary conditions, $k^2=\omega^2\rho/E$ is the wave number, $\omega=2 \pi f$ where $f$ is the frequency, and $i=\sqrt{-1}$.
By assuming [eq2] is a solution to [eq1], we can solve [eq1] in the frequency domain by taking a Fourier transform of $u(x,t)$ to get $U(x,\omega)$.  The frequency domain version of [eq1] is the Helmholtz equation given by
\begin{equation}
    E\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2}-\rho\omega^2 U=0.
\label{eq3}
\end{equation}
[eq3] is easily solved in MOOSE where $U$ is the state variable.  The first term on the right hand side is still captured by the [StressDivergence.md] kernel.  The second RHS term, $\rho\omega^2 U$, is captured by the [Reaction](/Reaction.md) kernel where the `Reaction` rate is given by $-\omega^2$.  [eq3] is only valid for small displacements and linear elasticity.  A damping term can also be included in [eq1] and [eq3].

The boundary conditions also need to be converted to the frequency domain through a Fourier transform.  A time harmonic Neumann BC given by
\begin{equation}
    f= A \, cos(2 \pi f t) \qquad \text{at} \, x=L
    \label{eq4}
\end{equation}
with amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$, is transformed to
\begin{equation}
    F= A \, \qquad \text{at} \, x=L
    \label{eq5}
\end{equation}


The simulated natural frequencies given by peaks in the FRF for a coarse mesh are:\\
$\omega_{1a}=$650Hz\\
$\omega_{1b}=$850Hz\\
where 50Hz frequency increments are used in the FRF frequency sweep. The FRF where each displacement is plotted separately is shown in [cantileverfrf] where each mode is excited separately.  A scaled displacement magnitude is shown in [cantileverfrfmag] for a coarse and fine mesh.  A coarse mesh shows a stiffer response and and the natural frequencies are over-estimated.  The natural frequencies converge on the analytic result from above as the mesh is refined.
The simulations will fail if they are run at the natural frequencies because the solution will become singular,
i.e the displacements blow-up as shown by the asymptotes in [cantileverfrf].

The input file for the coarse simulation shown in [cantileverfrfmag] and [cantileverfrf] is given in [listing0].

This uses the [SolidMechanics QuasiStatic Physics](Physics/SolidMechanics/QuasiStatic/index.md) to setup the StressDivergence Kernels because this simulation only includes real displacements.  A `Transient` executioner with a `ConstantDT` timestepper is used to sweep over frequencies where the time is substituted for the frequency.  The time is converted to the frequency dependent `Reaction` `rate` using a `ParsedFunction` and is applied to the `rate` using the `RealFunctionControl`.

In the next example, imaginary displacements will be introduced by including an absorbing boundary condition.  Imaginary displacement represent a phase shift in the problem and often result from damping.

## Uniaxial Beam Example

In the Fourier domain, The displacement field $U$ is in general a complex number.  In the previous example, only the real part of the displacement field was accounted for.  In this example, an absorbing boundary condition will introduce a coupling between the real and imaginary displacement fields.  This example uses the uniaxial beam shown in [cantilever] which is subjected to time-harmonic displacement on right and has an absorbing boundary condition on left.

For the boundary condition, we apply the Sommerfeld radiation condition on the left, and a harmonic source (cosine) on the right as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt E \, \nabla u= i\sqrt \rho \, \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \, \qquad \text{at} \, x=0
\label{eq6}
\end{equation}
The frequency domain version of [eq6] is
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} U= ik\sqrt\frac{\rho}{E} U \qquad \text{at} \, x=0,
    \label{eq7}
\end{equation}

As mentioned before, $U$ is complex-valued function/variable in the form of $U_r+iU_i$ where $U_r$ and $U_i$ are the real and the imaginary part of $U$.  At this stage, we split the complex system of equations into two real valued systems that live on the same mesh. [eq3] for a complex valued system becomes
\begin{equation}
    E\frac{\partial^2 U_r}{\partial x^2}- \rho\omega^2  U_r = 0
    \\
    E\frac{\partial^2 U_i}{\partial x^2}- \rho\omega^2  U_i = 0
    \label{eq8}
\end{equation}
The Sommerfeld boundary conditions are given by
\begin{equation}
   \frac{\partial U_r}{\partial x}= -k U_i\, \qquad \text{at} \, x=0\\
   \frac{\partial U_i}{\partial x}= k U_r\, \qquad \text{at} \, x=0,\\
   U_r=A \, \qquad \text{at} \, x=L,\\
   U_i=0 \, \qquad \text{at} \, x=L,
   \label{eq9}
\end{equation}
Note that this decomposition is exact and no information is lost from the decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The real and imaginary [StressDivergence.md] kernels are shown in [listing1].  Care must be taken in defining these kernels and the respective displacements for the problem.  Setting the displacements in the `[GlobalParams]` block could have unintended consequences and should be set in the individual kernels that use them.  Also note that, as a result of the radiation BCs on left, $U_r$ and $U_i$ are coupled, hence the two systems in [eq8] are needed.  The Sommerfeld radiation BCs are applied using a [CoupledVarNeumannBC.md] in [listing2].

For this example given in [listing1] and [listing2], the Young's modulus and the density are constants equal to unity.  The amplitude and frequency of the harmonic displacement BC in [eq9] are $A=5$ and $\omega=10$.

The analytical solution of [eq8] and the associated boundary conditions in [eq9] are obtained by expressing the solution of $U$ as a combination of sines and cosines representing the traveling and reflecting waves, i.e $U=C_1 e^{ikx} + C_2e^{-ikx}$.

Applying the boundary conditions, and considering the wave to travel in the negative $x$ direction, we obtain, $C_1=0$ with $C_2=0.5/(e^{-ikL})$. Plugging these values into the analytical solution gives: $U=0.5 e^{ik(L-x)}.$
The moose solution for this problem is shown in [solution].
