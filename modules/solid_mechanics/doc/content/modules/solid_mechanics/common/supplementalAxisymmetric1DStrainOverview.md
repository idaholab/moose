This material assumes symmetry about the $z$ axis and must be used on blocks
with `COORD_TYPE = RZ`. The radial coordinate is the physical $x$ coordinate.
In the 1D strain tensor, the radial strain is stored in the `xx` component, the
generalized plane strain component is stored in the axial `yy` component, and
the hoop strain is stored in the `zz` component. The stress divergence is
handled by the axisymmetric RZ kernels, such as
[StressDivergenceRZTensors](/StressDivergenceRZTensors.md).
