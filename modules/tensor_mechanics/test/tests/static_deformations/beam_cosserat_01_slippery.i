# Beam bending.  One end is clamped and the other end is subjected to
# a constant surface traction.
# The beam thickness is 1, and the Cosserat layer thickness is 0.5,
# so the beam contains 2 Cosserat layers.
# The joint normal stiffness is set very large and the shear stiffness very small
# so that the situation should be very close to a single beam of thickness
# 0.5.
# The deflection should be described by
# u_z = 2sx/G + 2s(1-nu^2)x^2(3L-x)/(Eh^2)
# wc_y = sx(x-2L)/(2B)
# Here
# s = applied shear stress = -2E-4
# x = coordinate along bar (0<=x<=10)
# G = shear modulus = E/2/(1+nu) = 0.4615
# nu = Poisson = 0.3
# L = length of bar = 10
# E = Young = 1.2
# h = Cosserat layer thickness = 0.5
