# checking for small deformation
# A single element is stretched by 0.75E-6m in the z and x directions
# This causes the return direction to be along the hypersurface sigma_I = sigma_II
# tensile_strength is set to 1Pa, tip_smoother = 0, edge_smoother = 25degrees
# Then A + B + C = 0.609965
#
# The final stress should have meanstress = 0.680118 and bar(sigma) = 0.52443, and sigma_zz = sigma_xx = 0.982896
