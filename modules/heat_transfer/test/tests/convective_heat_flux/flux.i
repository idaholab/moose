# This is a test of the ConvectiveHeatFluxBC.
# There is a single 1x1 element with a prescribed temperature
# on the left side and a convective flux BC on the right side.
# The temperature on the left is 100, and the far-field temp is 200.
# The conductance of the body (conductivity * length) is 10
#
# If the conductance in the BC is also 10, the temperature on the
# right side of the solid element should be 150 because half of the
# temperature drop should occur over the body and half in the BC.
#
# The integrated flux is deltaT * conductance, or -50 * 10 = -500.
# The negative sign indicates that heat is going into the body.
