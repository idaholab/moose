## Overview

The direct perturbation method is the simplest approach for
computing local sensitivity coefficients using the finite
difference approximation of the derivatives at a certain
point in the parameter domain. The coordinates of the reference
location can be supplied through the [!param](/Samplers/DirectPerturbationSampler/nominal_parameter_values) parameter.
The parameter vector holding the parameters can be denoted by:
$\vec{\mu}=\left[\mu_1,\mu_2,\mu_3,...,\mu_{N_p}\right]^T$, where
$N_p$ is the number of parameters. The direct perturbation-based
sensitivity coefficients can then be computed using the
following two methods:

- +Central difference approximation:+
  We assume that the sensitivity coefficient for parameter
   $\mu_i$ can be approximated as:

  \begin{equation}
  S_{\mu_i} =\frac{\Phi(\vec{\mu}_{i+})-\Phi(\vec{\mu}_{i-})}{\mu_{i+}-\mu_{i-}},
  \end{equation}

  where $\vec{\mu}_{i+/-}$ are the vectors with the $i$-th entries
  perturbed in the positive and negative direction (so they
  are replaced by $\mu_{i+}$ and $\mu_{i-}$), respectively.
  Parameter [!param](/Samplers/DirectPerturbationSampler/relative_perturbation_intervals) can be used to specify
  the perturbation interval around the nominal values. For the
  central difference approach a 0.1 value would mean that the
  parameter is perturbed by 5% in both directions making the
  total perturbation centered around the nominal value. This
  approach is more accurate, but needs $2N_p$ model evaluations.

- +Forward difference approximation:+
  We assume that the sensitivity coefficient for parameter
   $\mu_i$ can be approximated as:

  \begin{equation}
  S_{\mu_i} =\frac{\Phi(\vec{\mu}_{i+})-\Phi(\vec{\mu})}{\mu_{i+}-\mu},
  \end{equation}

  where $\vec{mu}_{i+}$ is the vector with the $i$-th entry
  perturbed in the positive direction (i.e. it is
  are replaced by $\mu_{i+}$).
  Parameter [!param](/Samplers/DirectPerturbationSampler/relative_perturbation_intervals) can be used to specify
  the perturbation interval from the nominal values. For the
  forward difference approach a 0.1 value would mean that the
  parameter is perturbed by 10% in one direction. This
  approach is less accurate, but only needs $N_p+1$ model
  evaluations.

This sampler is responsible for creating parameter vectors with
perturbed entries. The computation of the sensitivity
coefficients is done using [DirectPerturbationReporter.md].
The differencing approach can be selected using the
[!param](/Samplers/DirectPerturbationSampler/perturbation_method)
parameter.
The implementation is fully parallelized meaning that the model
evaluations and the sensitivity calculation all happen in
parallel.


## Example Input Syntax

the following input generates perturbed samples for a
3-dimensional parameter space around a nominal value
using the central difference approach.
