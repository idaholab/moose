# TODO: Figure out how to capture the output from InteractiveInterpreter
#       so we don't see all the Cubit BS
#
#       I found a way to do this using the context manager class
#       and __future__ module but this doesn't exist in Python2.5

# For now the easiest thing to do is to pipe this command through grep
# All of the commands that I write begin with a lower case letter
# so the following RegEx should work

#  | grep "^[a-z]"
#  or
#  | grep "[[:lower:]]"
