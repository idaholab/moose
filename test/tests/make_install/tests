# Copying tests with the binary is intended to copy from an installed location
# (i.e. after "make install"). The logic in the binary however attempts to find
# installed tests relative to the binary location, which is also installed
# through "make install". If we run it from the non-installed version of the binary
# it'll look for tests in <bin location>/../share/moose_test/tests/. To get
# line coverage, we'll just copy a file to that area.
# See application_development/build_system.md for more information.
