"""
Drive a MOOSE-generated FMU step-by-step (manual do_step loop).

Why step-by-step?
-----------------
- You control the communication step (dt) and the timing of information
  exchanges precisely at t0 + n*dt.
- Useful when you need exact alignment at the stop time (t1), or when you want
  to interleave custom logic (e.g., fixed-point coupling, data logging, or
  external synchronization) between steps.
- The FMU's *internal* integration step is fixed at FMU build time in MOOSE.
  Step-by-step does not change that internal dt, but it *does* control how
  often the co-simulation master exchanges data (do_step calls).
