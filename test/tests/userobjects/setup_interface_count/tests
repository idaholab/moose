# The following tests are designed to count how often the setup methods are called (initialSetup, etc.),
# which requires that the threading be disabled because the counts may differ.
#
# GeneralUserObject must also be restricted for a certain MPI because
# their methods will be called on each processor, since they are not
# distributed in any fashion.
#
# Other UserObject tests here include a subdomainSetup count, which
# depends on the number of transitions between subdomains while
# iterating over local elements, which depend on how mesh
# partitioning assigns local elements.  We'll just run them all in
# serial.
