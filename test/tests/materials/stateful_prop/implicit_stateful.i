# This test checks that material properties are correctly implicitly be
# promoted to "stateful" when a stateful old or older value is requested for
# them even when the properties were never explicitly declared with old/older
# support.  So the ImplicitStateful material simply requests stateful
# old/older values from a generic constant material that doesn't declare its
# material property with old/older support.  This material adds the current
# simulation time to that to calculate its own material property. A second
# implicit stateful material requests the older value of the firsts stateful
# material - also not declared to support old/older as its material property
# value.  The sequence of material properties generated by the second implicit
# stateful material should be delayed by the first's by one time step.
