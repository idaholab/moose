## Functional Expansion Tools

A MOOSE module for continuous, mesh-agnostic, high-fidelity, reduced-data MultiApp coupling

Functional expansions (FXs) are a methodology that represent information as moments of a functional
series [!citep](Flusser2016). This is related to a Fourier series representation of cyclic
data. Moments are generated via numerical integration for each term in the functional series to
represent the field of interest. These moments can then be used to reconstruct the field in a
separate app [!citep](Wendt2018a,Wendt2017c,Kerby2017).

## Geochemistry

Solves geochemical models. The capabilities include:

- Equilibrium aqueous systems
- Redox disequilibrium
- Sorption and surface complexation
- Kinetics
- All of the above combined with fluid and heat transport

It is designed to interface easily with the porous flow module so that complicated reactive transport scenarios can be studied.

!equation
\rho c_p \pf{T}{t} - \nabla\cdot k \nabla T - s = 0

Also contains capability for generalized heat transfer (convection, radiation, ...).

## Level Set

The level set module provides basic functionality to solve the level set equation, which is
simply the multi-dimensional advection equation:

!equation

## Navier Stokes

- A weakly compressible formulation (FV)
- A fully compressible formulation (FV)

Zero-dimensional turbulence models are available and coarse regularized k-epsilon will be added soon.
