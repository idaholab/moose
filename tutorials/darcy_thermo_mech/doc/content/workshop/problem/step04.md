# Step 4: Velocity Auxiliary Variable id=step04

!---

The velocity is the primary variable of interest, it is computed based on the pressure as:

!equation
\vec{u} = -\frac{\mathbf{K}}{\mu} \nabla p

## DarcyVelocity AuxKernel

The primary unknown ("nonlinear variable") is the pressure

Once the pressure is computed, the AuxiliarySystem can compute and output the velocity field using
the coupled pressure variable and the permeability and viscosity properties.

Auxiliary variables come in two flavors: Nodal and Elemental.

Nodal auxiliary variables cannot couple to gradients of nonlinear variables since gradients of $C_0$
continuous variables are not well-defined at the nodes.

Elemental auxiliary variables can couple to gradients of nonlinear variables since evaluation
occurs in the element interiors.
