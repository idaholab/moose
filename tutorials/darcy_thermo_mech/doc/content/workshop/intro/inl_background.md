### Established in 2005, INL is the lead nuclear energy R&D laboratory for the Department of Energy

#### "Establish a world-class capability in the modeling and simulation of advanced energy systems..." style=color:grey;

!---

- INL is the one of the largest employers in Idaho with 6,200 employees and 478 interns
- In 2024 the INL budget was over $2 billion

!---

INL is the site where 52 nuclear reactors were designed and constructed, including the
first reactor to generate usable amounts of electricity: Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-1)

## Advanced Test Reactor (ATR)

- World's most powerful test reactor (250 MW thermal)
- Constructed in 1967
- Volume of 1.4 cubic meters, with 43 kg of uranium, and operates at 60C

## Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT)

TREAT is a test facility specifically designed to evaluate the response
of fuels and materials to accident conditions

High-intensity (+20 GW+), short-duration (+80 ms+) neutron pulses for severe accident testing

## National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC)

NRIC is composed of two physical test beds to build prototypes of advanced nuclear reactors

- DOME (Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments) in the historic EBR-II facility, a test bed site capable of hosting operational nuclear reactor concepts that produce less than 20MW thermal power.

- LOTUS (Laboratory for Operation and Testing in the U.S.) in the historic Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) Cell, a test bed site capable of hosting operational nuclear reactor concepts that produce less than 500kW thermal power.

And an open-source [online virtual test bed](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/virtual_test_bed)
to demonstrate advanced reactors through modeling and simulation. More information about NRIC can be found at [https://nric.inl.gov](https://nric.inl.gov).
