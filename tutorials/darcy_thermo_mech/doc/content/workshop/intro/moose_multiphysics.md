# Multiphysics Simulation

!---

## Historical Multiphysics Simulation

- Predictive multiphysics capability involved best-estimate calculations

  - Best estimates: data and correlation driven, many approximations
  - Necessitated experimental data for each design

- Physics performed independently

  - Was a "siloed" task; handoffs of data/results from person to person

- Codes are very computationally efficient and well validated

  - ... but the process wasn't necessarily efficient

- Used many approximations for evaluations of safety parameters

  - Pin-power reconstruction, gap conductance, spacer grid models

!---

## Current Multiphysics Simulation

- Direct, physics-based models of all components

  - Reduces approximations as needed
  - Can be computationally expensive
  - Validation?

- Tighter and consistent coupling

  - How separate - full coupling or loose coupling?

- Length and time scales of physics can be vastly different

  - What does this change for the analyst?

- Quite new: +validation of direct physics-based models are not as well validated+

## Writing a Multiphysics Code

- Scientists are adept at creating applications in their domain
- What about collaborating across research groups and/or disciplines?

  - Iterating between design teams?
  - Development of "coupling" codes?

## Modularity is Key

- Data should be accessed through strict interfaces with code having separation of responsibilities

  - Allows for "decoupling" of code
  - Leads to more reuse and less bugs
  - +Challenging for FEM+

    - Shape functions, degrees of freedom, meshing, quadrature points, material properties, analytic functions, global integrals, data transfer, ...
    - The complexity makes computational science codes brittle and hard to reuse

- A consistent set of "systems" are needed to carry out common actions, these systems should be
  separated by interfaces

## MOOSE Pluggable Systems

- Systems break apart responsibility
- No direct communication between systems
- Data flows through MOOSE interfaces
- Objects can be mixed and matched to achieve simulation goals
- An object, by itself, can be lifted from one application and used by another

## MOOSE Coupling Strategy

- Numerically separates a multiphysics solve by physics components (equations)

  - Connect physics together via in-memory transfer of fields and scalars

- Input file based

  - No code needed!

- There is no single unique hierarchy to solve a specific problem

  - Multiple may exist, some may be more efficient

- +Provides a standardized interface for an analyst to produce a coupled model+
