# Step 4: Materials id=ictp_step4

!---

- Add individual material properties for fuel and cladding
- Consider this now to be a real "heat conduction" problem
- Set inner boundary condition reflecting (no BC)
- Set outer boundary condition to water temperature (300K)
- Add a parabolic volumetric heat source to the problem to represent heating from fission
