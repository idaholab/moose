# Step 2: Simple Heat Conduction Kernel id=step02

## Implementing equations in MOOSE

To implement the Heat Conduction equation, we will use a [Kernel](Kernels/index.md) object to compute the
residual and the Jacobian of the diffusion term:

!equation
-\nabla \cdot k \nabla T = 0,

where  $k$  is the thermal diffusivity.

A `Kernel` is C++ class, which inherits from `MooseObject` that is used by MOOSE for coding
volume integrals of a [!ac](PDE).

## CoefDiffusion Kernel

The heat conduction equation amounts to a diffusion equation with a coefficient.

!equation
-\nabla \cdot k \nabla T = 0,

where  $k$  is the thermal diffusivity.

To implement the coefficient a new Kernel object must be used: [CoefDiffusion](CoefDiffusion.md).

This object inherits from [Diffusion](Diffusion.md) and will use input parameters for specifying the
diffusivity.

## Step 2: Input File

We introduce block restriction to differentiate between water and concrete.
Block restriction is a common feature of MOOSE objects, introduced by setting

```text
block = 'concrete'
```
