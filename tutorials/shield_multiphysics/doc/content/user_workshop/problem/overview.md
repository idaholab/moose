# Problem Statement

!---

We will study the cooling of the concrete shielding around a future micro-reactor in the DOME Test Bed at the National Reactor
Innovation Center in Idaho.

This example was created independently from studies at NRIC and INL. The dimensions have been modified
and numerous systems and complexities are omitted.

## Physics of Interest

- Concrete Domain: +Thermal Mechanics+

  - Heat conduction of the thermal radiation from the reactor to the boundary of shield.
  - Mechanical displacement and stress from the thermal expansion.

- Water Domain: +Thermal Fluids+

  - Heat transfer through the fluid and back-and-forth from the concrete.
  - Natural convection of the fluid due to the temperature gradients.
