# Step 4: Heat Conduction kernel with Material id=step04

!---

Instead of passing constant coefficients to the heat conduction kernel, we use the Material system to supply
the values.

!equation
-\nabla \cdot k \nabla T = 0,

where $k$ is the thermal conductivity.

This system allows for properties that vary in space and time, that can be coupled to variables
in the simulation.

## HeatConductionMaterial

Three material properties must be produced for consumption by kernels of the heat conduction equation:

- thermal conductivity by the conduction term
- density and specific heat by the time derivative of the energy

Both shall be computed with a single [Material](Materials/index.md) object: [HeatConductionMaterial](HeatConductionMaterial.md).

## HeatConduction Kernel

The [CoefDiffusion](CoefDiffusion.md) Kernel object uses input parameters for defining the thermal
conductivity. Instead, the [HeatConduction](HeatConduction.md) Kernel utilizes the material
properties defined in [HeatConductionMaterial](HeatConductionMaterial.md) automatically.

Note: we use kernels with automatic differentiation (AD) for simplicity.
