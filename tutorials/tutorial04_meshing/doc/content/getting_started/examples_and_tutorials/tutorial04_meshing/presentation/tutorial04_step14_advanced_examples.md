## Possible Advanced Reactor Geometries

This tutorial covers the generation of mostly standard geometries, but many reactor designs involve features which were not covered previously. Using the tools covered in this section, MOOSE can generate quite complex geometries illustrated here. The key mesh generators required are listed briefly.

## Boundary Layers and Biasing

During the mesh refinement process, it is common to require finer discretizations in one region and coarser discretizations in another region. The boundary layer and biasing features available in the Reactor Module allow the user to refine the mesh in areas of interest for the physics problem at hand.

!---

### Mesh Biasing

Mesh biasing applies non-uniform meshing subintervals within a specific region. For example, a fuel pin may generally require an axial meshing size of 5 cm, but at the very top and bottom of the active fuel zone where the power shape has a larger gradient, the user may require finer grids. This is possible using mesh biasing parameters available in [AdvancedExtruderGenerator.md].

### Radial Mesh Biasing

Similarly, the user may want to radially bias the mesh where solution gradients are known to be high, for example at the edge of a fuel pin or control rod. This is possible using mesh biasing parameters in [PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.md] as well as [PeripheralRingMeshGenerator.md].

### Mesh Boundary Layers

Boundary layers are commonly needed in thermal-hydraulic applications, where the thickness of the mesh near a wall must be a certain size, uniformly, regardless of the width of the meshed region. Boundary layers are possible using [PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.md] and [PeripheralRingMeshGenerator.md].

## Stitching Assemblies with Different Pin Numbers

Typical reactor cores are comprised of many different assembly types, each with different numbers of pins. It is difficult to find a reasonably low azimuthal discretization for each assembly such that all assemblies have the same number of nodes on their boundaries.

The best approach for this situation is to use [PatternedHexPeripheralModifier.md] to strip the outermost layer off each assembly and replace it with a transition layer with a set number of nodes on the outermost boundary.

## Oversized Pin

Some assemblies contain an oversized pin which intrudes on neighboring unit pin cells. Here, we describe one possible approach to mesh this situation.

First, define the regular small fuel pins and place them into the assembly as a full lattice. Separately, the oversized pin should be defined as its own object, remembering to remove the background region which is created by default in [PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.md]. Finally, [XYDelaunayGenerator.md] is used to mesh the regions between the assembly (with deleted dummies) and the oversized pin.

## Filling Between Curves using "FillBetweenSidesetsGenerator"

The MSRE 2D lattice case was constructed using the [FillBetweenSidesetsGenerator.md] to connect "quarter" circular pins. First, [ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.md] (a predecessor of [PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.md] which has a different set of input options and works only for square pin cells) was used to create two quarter pins.

## Triangulation of Odd-Shaped Regions Using "ParsedCurveGenerator" and "XYDelaunayGenerator"

This example demonstrates how to place a control drum object in an arbitrary position in a core that may overlap subdomain boundaries.

First, the center assembly is created using regular pins and procedures.

## Triangulation of Odd-Shaped Regions (cont.)

Next, two circular peripheral regions are added using [PeripheralTriangleMeshGenerator.md] (yellow, purple zones).

## Triangulation of Odd-Shaped Regions (cont.)

Next, the complex boundary shape which is the outer edge of the light blue zone is defined using [ParsedCurveGenerator.md] and analytic piecewise functions. The interior of this boundary is then filled in, including the center assembly, using [XYDelaunayGenerator.md].

!col small=12 medium=6 large=8

## Triangulation of Odd-Shaped Regions (cont.)

The control drum object is defined including the absorber arc using [PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.md] and [AzimuthalBlockSplitGenerator.md], then the background region of the control drum is deleted to leave only the circular part. This mesh is then translated into the desired position of the final mesh using [TransformGenerator.md]. The small red pin is defined similarly (not requiring [AzimuthalBlockSplitGenerator.md]).

## Triangulation of Odd-Shaped Regions (cont.)

The outer boundary of the dark blue zone is then generated using [ParsedCurveGenerator.md] and analytical functions. [XYDelaunayGenerator.md] is again used to fill the dark blue regions, keeping the light blue region and assembly, control drum, and small pin.

## Triangulation of Odd-Shaped Regions (cont.)

Finally, a circular peripheral region is added at the end using [PeripheralTriangleMeshGenerator.md] (yellow).
