class ChiggerSourceBase(ChiggerObject):
    """
    A base class for creating "source" objects (in VTK something that uses an vtkActor).

    The term "source" is used generically here to represent an entity that is represented with a
    vtkActor. Note, that this class is even more generic in that the required bases (see
    VTKACTOR_TYPE and VTKMAPPER_TYPE) will allow for both 2D and 3D actor/mappers.

    Any Set/Get VTK methods that can be applied to the base types (see VTKACTOR_TYPE and
    VTKMAPPER_TYPE) should be applied in this class, therefore the settings will then propagate to
    all classes deriving from this, hopefully eliminating duplicate code and options.

    Inputs: vtkactor_type: The VTK actor type to build, must be an instance of VTKACTOR_TYPE
    vtkmapper_type: The VTK mapper type to build, must be an instance of VTKMAPPER_TYPE **kwargs:
    The key, value options for this object.
