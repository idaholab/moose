# TestHarness

The TestHarness is the Python code behind the `run_tests` script in MOOSE and every MOOSE-based
application.  It is responsible for finding tests and running them.  Here we describe how to use
the `run_tests` script and how to create your own tests.

The ideas behind testing are described over the in the [MOOSE Test System](test_system.md optional=True)
documentation.

## run_tests

`run_tests` is a small Python script that can be found in every MOOSE-based application and in the
framework itself (under `moose/test`).  The `run_tests` script will find tests and run them with your
compiled binary for your app. There is also a `run_tests` script in the `moose/scripts` which you may
consider adding to your system PATH to conveniently run tests in any directory containing test specification
files.

## Basic Usage

To run the tests for any application, make sure the executable is built (generally by running `make`)
and then do:

```bash
./run_tests -j 8
```

There are many options for `run_tests`, but the `-j` option shown above is by far the most widely
used.  It tells the `run_tests` script how many processors to utilize on your local machine for
running tests concurrently.  Put the correct number there (instead of 8). The script will then go
find and run your tests and display the results. More detail on concurrency can be found
[below](TestHarness.md#parallel).

## More Options id=moreoptions

To see more options for `run_tests` you can invoke it with `-h`.  There are many options to look
through, but some of the important ones are:

- `--failed-tests`: Runs the tests that just failed.  Note: as long as you keep using this
  option the set of failed tests will not change.
- `--n-threads <n>`: Causes the tests to run with `#` of (OpenMP/Pthread/TBB) threads.
- `-p <n>`: Causes the tests to run with `#` MPI processes.  Useful for guaranteeing that you get the
  same result in parallel!
- `--valgrind`: Run all of the tests with the [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org) utility.  Does
  extensive memory checking to catch segfaults and uninitialized memory errors.
- `--recover`: Run all of the tests in "recovery" mode.  This runs the test halfway, stops, then
  attempts to "recover" it and run until the end.  This is very rigorous testing that tests whether
  everything in your application can work with restart/recover.

- `--restep`: Run all of the tests in "restep" mode. This triggers the middle
  timestep of the simulation to be rejected and redone. This emulates the
  behavior of a failed solve on timestep, where it tries again with a smaller
  timestep size; except "restep" does not change the size. The goal is to test
  if the system retains any state after a timestep is rejected and have
  different behavior when it is repeated, where this test mode will likely show
  a failure. The `--restep` flag simply runs the tests with the command-line
  option `--test-restep`, which can be used to help debug restep failures.
  Common causes of restep failures include:

  - The system could not find the middle timestep properly. Setting `num_steps`
    to something close to the actual number of steps will resolve this.
  - [Controls](Controls/index.md) objects executing on `timestep_end`. Consider
    changing the test's logic to use `timestep_begin` controls instead.
  - Unresolved dependencies between objects. Most commonly, this involves
    function-postprocessor dependencies and cyclic dependencies between user
    objects.
  - Stateful class member variables in objects. Typically, this can be resolved
    by checking if the current timestep is greater than the previous timestep
    the object was run on. See
    [Predictor::timestepSetup](framework/src/predictors/Predictor.C) for an
    example.
  - Specifying `Executioner/abort_on_solve_fail=true` in the test input or
    in the command line arguments (`cli_args`).

- `--opt` (The default) Builds an optimized executable suitable for running calculations.
- `--dbg` An executable meant for use in a debugger (like gdb or lldb). Will be very slow and not meant to be used on large problems
- `--oprof` Not normally used. Can be used for "code profiling": running your code with a utility like oprof, gprof, vtune, etc.
- `--pro` An alias to `--oprof`
- `--devel` Something in-between opt and dbg. Attempts to be faster but also does some more run-time checks (asserts and mooseAsserts)

## `testroot`

The `testroot` file is a small configuration file that is formatted like a MOOSE input file.  It is
read by the `run_tests` script.  It should be placed in the root of your application directory
(i.e. right next to where the binary is).  Some things you can set in that file are:

- `app_name`: A unique, short name for your application.
- `allow_warnings`: `true` by default, set this to `false` to make all warnings from running tests be
  _errors_ instead.
- `allow_override` and `allow_unused`: `true` by default if set to `false` then syntax errors in your
  test input files will be treated as errors.

The one thing we do +not+ recommend is enforcing that the use of deprecated code should be treated
like an error.  That is entirely too rigid of a requirement and impedes the normal flow of
development.  Instead, developers should periodically run their tests with `--error-deprecated` to
see if any of their tests are using deprecated code / parameters and then fix them up at that point.
The MOOSE team is not responsible for fixing deprecated code.

# Testers

Testers represent individual tests in MOOSE. Testers encompass a set of instructions for performing
a task and then verifying the result. There are several built-in testers in the framework but the
Tester system is completely pluggable and extendable. The list of default testers is listed here:

- [RunApp](RunApp.md) (includes syntax-only checking)
- [RunCommand](RunCommand.md)
- [RunException](RunException.md)
- [Exodiff](Exodiff.md)
- [CSVDiff](testers/CSVDiff_tester.md)
- [JSONDiff](JSONDiff.md)
- [XMLDiff](XMLDiff.md)
- [ImageDiff](ImageDiff.md)
- [CSVValidationTester](CSVValidationTester.md)
- [FileTester](FileTester.md)
- [CheckFiles](CheckFiles.md)
- [AnalyzeJacobian](AnalyzeJacobian.md)
- [PetscJacobianTester](PetscJacobianTester.md)
- [PythonUnitTest](PythonUnitTest.md) (includes [Method of Manufactured solutions](python/mms.md) testing)


## Test Specifications

Tests are controlled by creating "test specification" files. By default, the TestHarness searches
a directory tree for files named "tests" (no extension). These files use the standard HIT syntax
that MOOSE [uses](/application_usage/input_syntax.html optional=True). An example is given below:

!listing moose/test/tests/kernels/simple_diffusion/tests

The available options depend on the Tester type; see the links above for lists of these options. Some common options include `capabilities`, which can for example, restrict the test to conditionally be skipped based on the testing configuration; see [Capabilities.md] for more information.

## Test Evaluation and Custom Evaluators

MOOSE has various configurations for evaluating whether a created test is successful or not. Depending on what type of Tester you specify in the "test specification" file, these can range from comparing the output of JSON, XML, CSV, or Exodus files, or matching a pattern in the output of the test using a regular expression.

Sometimes, it may not be possible to properly evaluate a test with the built-in checks MOOSE provides. In this situation, MOOSE has functionality for evaluating a test using a custom, user-supplied evaluation function.

To do this, create a Python script in the folder containing your test. The script should be blank aside from a single function named `custom_evaluation(output)`:

```
def custom_evaluation(output):
  #Do your evaluation logic here
  if output == "foo":
    return True
  return False
```

`output` is a string containing the test's entire output and can be manipulated as one sees fit. The function should return a boolean representing whether the test passed or not.

After creating the .py file, add `custom_evaluation_script = '[filename].py'` to your test specification file. For example:

```
[Tests]
  [my_test]
    type = RunApp
    input = my_input.i
    custom_evaluation_script = 'my_custom_eval.py'
  []
[]
```

## Parallel Test Execution id=parallel

The TestHarness is designed to schedule several tests (jobs) concurrently. The `-j <n>` option to the
run_tests script determines the numbers of available "slots" that may be used for testing. For maximum
utilization of a given machine, this number should be set to the number of cores available on the system.
The TestHarness will not oversubscribe a machine. When running with different combinations of parallel or
threaded testing, each job will consume multiple slots (e.g. A test running with 2 MPI processes and 2 threads
would consume 4 jobs slots).

To reduce the chance of tests in the same directory from writing to one or more of the same output or checkpoint
files concurrently, the TestHarness normally only schedules a single job from a single directory (test specification)
at a time. Concurrency is achieved by scheduling several tests from different directories at the same time.
It is possible however to tell the TestHarness that tests from the same directory should be scheduled at the same
time by using the parallel_scheduling syntax (shown below). Care should be taken when using this parameter to
avoid race conditions with file output. Extensive use of this parameter is discouraged. It should be used in
places where splitting up tests into separate folders is cumbersome, or splits of several related tests.

```
[Tests]
  parallel_scheduling = True

  [test1]
     ...
  []
  [test2]
     ...
  []
  [test3]
     ...
  []
[]
```

!alert note
The "prereq" parameter is still honored when using "parallel_scheduling = True".


# Influential Environment Variables id=environment

#### PYTHONPATH

PYTHONPATH instructs python to include the designated paths while attempting to import python modules. +While normally not needing to be set+, sometimes it is necessary. For example, when testing the TestHarness (unittests). Another use-case, is when a developer wants to utilize the moosedocs system for creating [moose documentation](MooseDocs/index.md optional=True) (the website you are using right now).

In either case, when you need to modify PYTHONPATH for MOOSE related development, you will almost always want to point it at `moose/python`.

PYTHONPATH functions just as PATH does (semi-colon separate list of paths, for which items contained within paths on the left, are found before items contained within paths on the right).

#### METHOD

Set the `METHOD` environment variable to one of the following to control which type of application binary to use:

| Variable Name | Argument | Usage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| METHOD | opt | TestHarness will use the binary built with optimizations while running tests: `your_appname-opt` (the default) |
| METHOD | dbg | TestHarness will use the binary built with debugging symbols while running tests: `your_appname-dbg` |
| METHOD | oprof | TestHarness will use the binary built with code profiling while running tests: `your_appname-oprof` |
| METHOD | pro | An alias for oprof |
| METHOD | devel | Something in-between opt and dbg |

!alert note
The methods described here can also be controlled via command line arguments. See "More Options" above.

#### MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT

Set `MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT` to any or all of the following, as well as in a particular order and case (restricted) to control where, what, and how the TestHarness prints that specific item:

| Variable Name | Argument | Usage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT | c | Print caveats |
| MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT | j | Print justification filler |
| MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT | p | Print pre-formatted status (10 character buffer fill) |
| MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT | s | Print status |
| MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT | n-N | Print test name |
| MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT | t | Print test completion time |

Example, if we set MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT to tpNsc, we would print the time, pre-formatted status, test name (converted to upper-case), long naming status, and then the caveats. In that order:

```bash
MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT=tpNsc ./run_tests --re=simple_diffusion.test -p4 -t
[0.141s]       OK KERNELS/AD_SIMPLE_DIFFUSION.TEST [OVERSIZED]
[0.144s]       OK KERNELS/SIMPLE_DIFFUSION.TEST [OVERSIZED]
```

Caveats with the... caveats of MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT; When caveats are requested to be printed last, the TestHarness will allow the entire caveat to print, regardless of MOOSE_TERM_COLS (see below).

#### MOOSE_TERM_COLS

Set `MOOSE_TERM_COLS` to a positive integer, to set the available terminal column count to this amount:

| Variable Name | Argument | Usage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| MOOSE_TERM_COLS | (int) | Allow for this many columns when printing output |

Example, if we set MOOSE_TERM_COLS to 50, we will restrict the default amount of columns the TestHarness normally uses while printing output:

```bash
MOOSE_TERM_COLS=50 ./run_tests --re=simple_diffusion.test
kernels/ad_simple_diffusion.test .............. OK
kernels/simple_diffusion.test ................. OK
--------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 2.9 seconds.
2 passed, 0 skipped, 0 pending, 0 failed
```

Caveats of MOOSE_TERM_COLS; If you specify too low a MOOSE_TERM_COLS, the TestHarness will only drop printing of the justification filler (see MOOSE_TERM_FORMAT above).

# Validation

The TestHarness can also be utilized for performing validation. The results of the validation checks are stored within the JSON  output that each test harness execution produces, providing a method to store the validation results in a database.

This validation is enabled via the `validation_test` parameter available within all TestHarness testers. This parameter is to be set to the path of a python script (within the tester directory) that contains the contents of the validation test(s).

See the following for a commented example for a script that would be provided as the `validation_test`:

!listing test_harness/validation_ok.py
