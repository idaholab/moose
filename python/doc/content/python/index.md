# MOOSE Tools

The MOOSE code itself is written in C++, but everything around it that supports it is written in
Python.  [python-packages] is a list of the tools/scripts developed in Python that are distributed
with MOOSE and [python/source/index.md] links to the source code documentation.

## Setup

MOOSE includes various python packages within the python directory. In order
to use these packages the python directory must be made available to the interpreter,
which is accomplished by setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. The following can be set on
the command line or inserted into your bash environment.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/projects/moose/python
```
