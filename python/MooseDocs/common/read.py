    Reads file using utf-8 encoding.

    This function exists simply for convenience and not needing to remember to use "codecs" when
    reading files.

    Additionally, it handles the MOOSE headers automatically. The prism.js package syntax
    highlighting messes up with the headers, so this makes them sane.

    Inputs:
        filename[str]: The filename to open.
