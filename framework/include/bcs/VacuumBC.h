/**
 * Implements a simple Vacuum BC for neutron diffusion on the boundary.
 * Vacuum BC is defined as \f$ D\frac{du}{dn}+\frac{u}{2} = 0\f$, where u is neutron flux.
 * Hence, \f$ D\frac{du}{dn}=-\frac{u}{2} \f$ and \f$ -\frac{u}{2} \f$ is substituted into
 * the Neumann BC term produced from integrating the diffusion operator by parts.
