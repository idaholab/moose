/**
 * This is the base class for Samplers as used within the Stochastic Tools module.
 *
 * A sampler is responsible for sampling distributions and providing an API for providing
 * the sample data to objects. The sampler is designed to handle any number of random number
 * generators.
 *
 * The main methods in this object is the getNextLocalRow/getSamples/getLocalSamples methods which
 * return the distribution samples. These methods will return the same results for each call
 * regardless of the number of calls, with getNextLocalRow being the exception because it is
 * designed be used in an iterative approach.
 *
 * Samplers support the use of "execute_on", which when called results in new set of random numbers,
 * thus after execute() calls to getSamples/getLocalSamples() methods will now produce a new set of
 * random numbers from calls prior to the execute() call.
 *
 * Not for MOOSE developers: Great care was taken to design the structure of this class to limit
 * access to the critical portions of this object while making it extensible. Please consider
 * carefully the impacts of altering the API.
