/**
 * Base class for objects constraining the value an MFEM variable may take within
 * one or more mesh subdomains, given by 'block'. It holds everything that does not
 * depend on whether the variable is real or complex; the two families of
 * constraint derive from it separately and each declares its own ApplyConstraint
 * taking the grid function type it acts on:
 *
 * - MFEMEssentialConstraint        (mfem::ParGridFunction)
 * - MFEMComplexEssentialConstraint (mfem::ParComplexGridFunction)
 *
 * This mirrors how MFEMBoundaryCondition relates to MFEMEssentialBC and
 * MFEMComplexEssentialBC.
