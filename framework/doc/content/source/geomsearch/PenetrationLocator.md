# PenetrationLocator

- A PenetrationLocator provides the perpendicular distance from a Secondary node to a Primary side and the "contact point" on the Primary side.
- The distance returned is negative if penetration hasn't yet occurred and positive if it has.
- To get a PenetrationLocator `#include "PenetrationLocator.h"` and call `getPenetrationLocator(primary_id, secondary_id)` to create the object.
- The algorithm in PenetrationLocator begins by using a [`NearestNodeLocator`](/NearestNodeLocator.md) so `patch_size` is still important.
- After a nearest node is found, elements neighboring that node are checked to find a contact point.  By default, the determination of "neighboring" relies on mesh topology and checks the elements which are directly connected to that node.  For meshes in which a surface element may touch a node that is not one of its own nodes (such as Flex IGA meshes, or adaptively refined in 3D, preceding use with `setUsePointLocator(true)` switches to a slower but more comprehensive octree-based algorithm.
- Most user interaction with a PenetrationLocator is likely to be through objects which inherit from `GeometricSearchInterface`.  Users can change the algorithm of PenetrationLocator by setting `search_method=all_proximate_sides` on such objects.
