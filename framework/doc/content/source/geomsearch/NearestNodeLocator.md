# NearestNodeLocator

- NearestNodeLocator provides the nearest node on a "Primary" boundary for each node on a "Secondary" boundary (and the other way around).
- The distance between the two nodes is also provided.
- It works by generating a "Neighborhood" of nodes on the Primary side that are close to the Secondary node.
- The size of the Neighborhood can be controlled in the input file by setting the `patch_size` parameter in the `Mesh` section.

- To use a NearestNodeLocator

  - `#include "NearestNodeLocator.h"`
  - call `getNearestNodeLocator(primary_id, secondary_id)` to create the object.

- The functions `distance()` and `nearestNode()` both take a node ID and return either the distance to the nearest node or a `Node` pointer for the nearest node respectively.
