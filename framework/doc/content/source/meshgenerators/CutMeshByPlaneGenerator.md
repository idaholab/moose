# CutMeshByPlaneGenerator

!syntax description /Mesh/CutMeshByPlaneGenerator

## Overview

The `CutMeshByPlaneGenerator` is basically the 3D version of [`XYMeshLineCutter`](/XYMeshLineCutter.md). It is used to slice a 3D input mesh along a given plane, and discard the portion of the mesh on one side of the plane. The input mesh, given by [!param](/Mesh/CutMeshByPlaneGenerator/input), must be 3D and contain only first-order elements. The cutting plane is specified by [!param](/Mesh/CutMeshByPlaneGenerator/plane_normal) and [!param](/Mesh/CutMeshByPlaneGenerator/plane_point), which are two `libMesh::Point` type data that represent the normal vector of the cutting plane and a point on the cutting plane, respectively. This mesh generator removes the part of the mesh located on the side of the plane in the direction of the normal vector. As each element that is across the cutting plane is cut based on the interception points, this mesh generator ensures a straight cut instead of a "zigzag" cut along element boundaries as generated by [`PlaneDeletionGenerator`](/PlaneDeletionGenerator.md).

## Methods

`CutMeshByPlaneGenerator` first converts all elements of the input mesh into `TET4` elements. Next, the `TET4` elements sliced by the cutting plane are further split into `TET4` elements. 

### Splitting of Non-TET4 Elements

The splitting of non-TET4 elements was performed using the same algorithm as described in [`ElementsToTetrahedronsConverter`](/ElementsToTetrahedronsConverter.md). Note that only those elements that will be fully or partially retained after the cutting are split.

### Cutting of TET4 Elements along Plane

Once all the elements of the input mesh have been converted into TET elements, the cutting method only needs to be applied to TET elements. First, all the elements that are cut by the given cutting plane are identified. For the TET elements involved, their relationship with the cutting plane can be categorized into one of the six cases shown in [tet_cut]. For each of these six cases, new nodes are created at the intersection points between the cutting plane and the edges of the TET element. Then the red part of the original TET element is removed and new TET element(s) are created as shown in [tet_cut]. The cross-sections created by this cutting procedure are assigned a new boundary ID as defined by [!param](/Mesh/CutMeshByPlaneGenerator/cut_face_id)

The red part of the original TET element is removed after cutting, while the blue part of the original TET element is kept and split into multiple TET elements if necessary.
