## Description

This family of objects collect a MOOSE variable or auxiliary variable given by [!param](/UserObjects/MOOSEVariableToNEML2/from_moose) for use as a NEML2 input variable or model parameter [!param](/UserObjects/MOOSEVariableToNEML2/to_neml2). The given variable is interpolated at each quadrature point.

The naming convention is

```
MOOSE[Old]VariableToNEML2
