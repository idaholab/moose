# JsonInputFileFormatter

This class produces a dump of the `InputParameters` that appears like the normal input
file syntax.
It is different from the [InputFileFormatter.md] in that it takes its input from JsonSyntaxTree.

This formatter is used for the `--dump` command line option, described
[here](application_usage/command_line_usage.md optional=True). It is also available for the
application developer, either directly or using an [AdvancedOutput](syntax/Outputs/index.md#advanced-output).

## Example output

We reproduce here the output of the `InputParameters` JSON dump for the [Functions](syntax/Functions/index.md)
block and the [MooseParsedFunction.md]. We can see the characteristic HIT syntax format, each parameter,
their default value if any, whether they are required or not, and each parameter's description.
This is output for every hierarchical level in the syntax.
