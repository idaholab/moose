# MFEMHypreAMS

## Summary

!syntax description /Solver/MFEMHypreAMS

## Overview

Defines and builds an `mfem::HypreAMS` solver to use as a preconditioner or solver to solve the
MFEM equation system. Most effective for preconditioning and solving a curl-curl problem when using
Nédélec elements, in which case the $H(\mathrm{curl})$ FE space should be passed to the
`mfem::HypreAMS` solver during construction.

If the system of equations is singular - commonly arising, for example, when solving for the
magnetic vector potential in magnetostatic systems in the steady state - users should set the
`singular` parameter to `true` to add a small mass term to ensure solvability.
