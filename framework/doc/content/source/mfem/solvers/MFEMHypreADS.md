# MFEMHypreADS

## Summary

!syntax description /Solver/MFEMHypreADS

## Overview

Defines and builds an `mfem::HypreADS` solver to use as a preconditioner or solver to solve the
MFEM equation system. Most effective for preconditioning and solving a grad-divergence problem when using
Raviart-Thomas elements, in which case the $H(\mathrm{div})$ FE space should be passed to the
`mfem::HypreADS` solver during construction.
