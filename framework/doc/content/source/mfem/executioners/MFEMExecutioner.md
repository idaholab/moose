# MFEMExecutioner

## Summary

Virtual base class for executioners used to solve MFEM FE problems.

## Overview

`MFEMExecutioner` is a purely virtual base class used to control the execution of MFEM FE problems.
Importantly, use of an `MFEMExecutioner` derived `Executioner` allows for selection of the desired
device and assembly strategy to use for the FE problem.

Provided MFEM and its dependencies have been built with support for GPU backends (e.g. `cuda` or
`hip`), they may be selected here to enable use of GPUs for solvers and during assembly.

Selection of partial assembly levels is also supported to improve performance on GPUs; full
description of the various assembly levels supported is available
 [here](https://mfem.org/performance/).

By default, legacy assembly of the FE problem on CPUs will be selected for robustness.
