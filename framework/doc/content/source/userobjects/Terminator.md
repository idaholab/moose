# Terminator

!syntax description /UserObjects/Terminator

The parsed logical expression is specified with the [!param](/UserObjects/Terminator/expression). More information about parsed expressions
may be found on the [function parser documentation](http://warp.povusers.org/FunctionParser/).

The `Terminator` can act in two modes, specified by the [!param](/UserObjects/Terminator/fail_mode) :

- `HARD` stop, the default, will terminate the simulation when the conditions are met

- `SOFT` stop, will stop the ongoing solve and let the solver try again using a smaller time step, for
  transient simulations.


!alert note
To use the `Terminator` as if it were in a `PASS` mode, where it stops the simulation and accepts the result, use the `HARD` fail_mode with the `INFO` error_level.

The message output by the `Terminator` when the condition for termination is met is specified using the
[!param](/UserObjects/Terminator/error_level) parameter. It may be output as:

- an error, forcing a hard failure

- a warning, to raise attention to an issue or abnormal solve conditions

- an information message, to indicate that while the `Terminator` is acting on the solve, the conditions
  met are expected or normal. This can be used to make the `Terminator` stop the simulation but accept the result.

An additional constraint may be added with the [!param](/UserObjects/Terminator/skip_evals) parameter,
which temporarily disables the terminator for the first `n` evaluations (usually the same as timesteps,
but when executed on `INITIAL`, this will change the count).


## Example input syntax

In this example, the `Terminator` is used to fail a time step solve, based on a criterion
`dt > 20`. Once the solve is soft-failed for this time step, the solver tries again by cutting
the time step. This happens to make the `Terminator` parsed criterion pass, so it does not act again
on this time step.

In this example, the `Terminator` is used to stop a simulation and accept the result once the following criterion is met:
`dt > 20`. Stopping simulation is done with the `HARD` failure mode, and the solve is considered as converged because the error level is set to `info`.
