# WebServerControl

The `WebServerControl` object is designed to allow an external process to control a MOOSE solve. It works by starting up a webserver which exposes a REST API. As with all REST APIs the input and output are both JSON.

The server can either listen on a port via the [!param](/Controls/WebServerControl/port) parameter, or on a unix file socket via the [!param](/Controls/WebServerControl/file_socket) parameter. One of these two parameters must be provided.

It can then be managed via the [MooseControl](moosecontrol/index.md optional=true) python utility.

## API

The `WebServerControl` presents REST endpoints to help control the solve.

For the endpoints that follow, if the HTTP status code received is a non-successful code, there may be a response of type `application/json` of the form:

```language=json
{
  "error": "<ERROR>"
}
```

where `<ERROR>` is a useful error message pertaining to the error that was encountered. The response is not guaranteed to contain `application/json` data, but it will when more context is available.

The REST endpoints are as follows:

### `check`

Used to determine if the MOOSE webserver is currently listening. This doesn't necessarily mean that it is waiting for input.

Interact with this endpoint by a `GET` request to `/check`. On success, the status code will be 200.

### `waiting`

Used to determine of MOOSE is currently waiting within the `WebServerControl`, i.e., that `Control` is waiting for external input. The rest of the endpoints that follow require that the control is currently waiting for input.

Interact with this endpoint by a `GET` request to `/waiting` without any data. If the control is currently waiting, the response will be of type `application/json` of the form:

```language=json
{
  "waiting": True
  "execute_on_flag": "<EXEC_ON_FLAG>"
}
```

where `<EXEC_ON_FLAG>` is the current execution flag. If the control is not currently waiting, the response will be a response of type `application/json` of the form:

```language=json
{
  "waiting": False
}
```

This endpoint can be accessed via the [MooseControl](moosecontrol/index.md optional=true) python utility via the following methods:

- `wait()`: Waits for the control to be waiting
- `getWaitingFlag()`: Gets the current flag that the control is waiting on, if any
- `isWaiting()`: Whether or not the control is currently waiting

### `get/postprocessor`

Used to obtain the value of a postprocessor. The control must be waiting in order to access this endpoint.

Interact with this endpoint by a `POST` request to `/get/postprocessor` with the following `application/json` data:

```language=json
{
  "name": "<NAME>"
}
```

where `<NAME>` is the name of the postprocessor whose value you wish to receive. The response will be of the form:

```language=json
{
  "value": <VALUE>
}
```

### `get/reporter`

Used to obtain a reporter value. The control must be waiting in order to access this endpoint.

Interact with this endpoint by a `POST` request to `/get/reporter` with the following `application/json` data:

```language=json
{
  "name": "<NAME>"
}
```

where `<NAME>` is the name of the reporter value (`object_name/value_name`) whose value you wish to receive. See [reporters](Reporters/index.md) for details on reporter values. The response will be of the form:

```language=json
{
  "value": <VALUE>
}
```

### `set/controllable`

Used to change a controllable parameter in the simulation. The control must be waiting in order to access this endpoint.

The following parameter types are currently supported by the endpoint:

- `bool`
- `Real`
- `std::string`
- `std::vector<Real>`
- `std::vector<std::string>`
- `RealEigenMatrix` (a.k.a. `Eigen::Matrix<Real>`)

These types can be extended by the `registerWebServerControl[Scalar/Vector][BoolNumberString]` registration methods in the source for the `WebServerControl`.

Interact with this endpoint by a `POST` request to `/set/controllable` with the following `application/json` data:

```language=json
{
  "name": "<NAME>",
  "type": "<TYPE>",
  "value": <VALUE>
}
```

where `<NAME>` is the string path to the controllable parameter, `<TYPE>` is the string version of the C++ parameter type, and `<VALUE>` is the value to set the parameter to. The type of `<VALUE>` depends on the controllable parameter type.

On success, the response will be empty with a status code of 201.

This endpoint can be accessed via the [MooseControl](moosecontrol/index.md optional=true) python utility via the following methods:

- `setControllableBool()`: Sets a controllable `bool` parameter
- `setControllableReal()`: Sets a controllable `Real` parameter
- `setControllableVectorReal()`: Sets a controllable `std::vector<Real>` parameter
- `setControllableString()`: Sets a controllable `std::string` parameter
- `setControllableVectorString()`: Sets a controllable `std::vector<std::string>` parameter
- `setControllableMatrix()`: Sets a controllable `RealEigenMatrix` parameter

### `continue`

Tells a waiting control to continue with the execution. The control must be waiting in order to access this endpoint.

Interact with this endpoint by a `GET` request to `/continue`. On success, the response will be empty with a status code of 200. This endpoint can be accessed via the [MooseControl](moosecontrol/index.md optional=true) python utility via `setContinue()`.

### `terminate`

Tells a waiting control to terminate the simulation at the end of the current timestep. Any other execution points in the control during the timestep will be skipped. The control must be waiting in order to access this endpoint.

Interact with this endpoint by a `GET` request to `/terminate`. On success, the response will be empty with a status code of 200. This endpoint can be accessed via the [MooseControl](moosecontrol/index.md optional=true) python utility via `setTerminate()`.
