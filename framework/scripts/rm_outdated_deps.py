# A python script to remove outdated dependency files and associated objects. It operates from any
# directory within the herd. It cleans out the moose directory and any herd animials included in the
# Makefile.

# Load the necessary packages
import os, sys, re

# Reads "Makefile" and searches for *.mk includes to build a list of directories to search
# for dependencies
#
# @param root_dir The MOOSE root directory (e.g., ~/projects/trunk/)
#
# @return A list of directories to clean
