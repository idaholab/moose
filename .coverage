# Coverage requirement configuration for moose, enforced in CIVET testing
#
# Valid configuration options:
# - require_new: Requires this percentage of coverage for new lines added
# - require_total: Requires this percentage of total coverage
# - warn_new: Warns below this percentage of coverage for new lines added
#
# Framework coverage is enforced by the 'framework' section and individual
# module coverage is handled by the section with the same name as the
# module, i.e., 'tensor_mechanics'. The 'default' section applies to all
# other cases.
